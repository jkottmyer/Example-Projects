        <div id="classdescription">
            <h1>Description</h1>
                <p>Golden eyes flashing, a human stretches out her hand and unleashes the dragonfire that burns in her veins. As an inferno rages around her foes, leathery wings spread from her back and she takes to the air.</p>
                <p>Long hair whipped by a conjured wind, a half-elf spreads his arms wide and throws his head back. Lifting him momentarily off the ground, a wave of magic surges up in him, through him, and out from him in a mighty blast of lightning.</p>   
                <p>Crouching behind a stalagmite, a halfling points a finger at a charging troglodyte. A blast of fire springs from her finger to strike the creature. She ducks back behind the rock formation with a grin, unaware that her wild magic has turned her skin bright blue.</p>
                <p>Sorcerers carry a magical birthright conferred upon them by an exotic bloodline, some otherworldly influence, or exposure to unknown cosmic forces. One can't study sorcery as one learns a language, any more than one can learn to live a legendary life. No one chooses sorcery; the power chooses the sorcerer.</p>
            <h1>Raw Magic</h1>
                <p>Magic is a part of every sorcerer, suffusing body, mind, and spirit with a latent power that waits to be tapped. Some sorcerers wield magic that springs from an ancient bloodline infused with the magic of dragons. Others carry a raw, uncontrolled magic within them, a chaotic storm that manifests in unexpected ways.</p>
                <p>The appearance of sorcerous powers is wildly unpredictable. Some draconic bloodlines produce exactly one sorcerer in every generation, but in other lines of descent every individual is a sorcerer. Most of the time, the talents of sorcery appear as apparent flukes. Some sorcerers can't name the origin of their power, while others trace it to strange events in their own lives. The touch of a demon, the blessing of a dryad at a baby's birth, or a taste of the water from a mysterious spring might spark the gift of sorcery. So too might the gift of a deity of magic, exposure to the elemental forces of the Inner Planes or the maddening chaos of Limbo, or a glimpse into the inner workings of reality.</p>
                <p>Sorcerers have no use for the spellbooks and ancient tomes of magic lore that wizards rely on, nor do they rely on a patron to grant their spells as warlocks do. By learning to harness and channel their own inborn magic, they can discover new and staggering ways to unleash that power.</p>
            <h1>Unexplained Powers</h1>
                <p>Sorcerers are rare in the world, and it's unusual to find a sorcerer who is not involved in the adventuring life in some way. People with magical power seething in their veins soon discover that the power doesn't like to stay quiet. A sorcerer's magic wants to be wielded, and it has a tendency to spill out in unpredictable ways if it isn't called on.</p>
                <p>Sorcerers often have obscure or quixotic motivations driving them to adventure. Some seek a greater understanding of the magical force that infuses them, or the answer to the mystery of its origin. Others hope to find a way to get rid of it, or to unleash its full potential. Whatever their goals, sorcerers are every bit as useful to an adventuring party as wizards, making up for a comparative lack of breadth in their magical knowledge with enormous flexibility in using the spells they know.</p>
                <h2 style="text-align: center;">Sorcerers in Verum follow the same rules as Standard 5e. <a style="font-size: inherit;" href="https://5e.tools/classes.html#sorcerer_phb" target="_blank">Official variants</a> are allowed as well as the variant(s) listed below.</h2>
            <h1><em>Linnorm Sorcerer</em></h1>
                <p><em>Your blood comes from the true dragons of Kalkatesh - the Linnorms. Your blood screams for their freedom and you will see to its restitution.</em></p>
            <h2>Level 1<hr></h2>
                <h3>Linnorm Lord</h3>
                    <p>At 1st level, you choose one type of dragon as your ancestor. The damage type associated with each dragon is used by features you gain later.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Crovux: Force / Radiant / Primal </li>
                        <li>Vallendrel: Poison / Acid / Primal </li>
                        <li>Fone: Cold / Thunder / Primal </li>
                        <li>Eldos Daikura: Necrotic / Psychic / Primal </li>
                        <li>Rhagdas: Fire / Radiant / Primal </li>
                        <li>Draaga: Lightning / Cold / Primal </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>You can speak, read, and write Draconic (Linnorm). Additionally, whenever you make a Charisma check when interacting with Linnorms, your Proficiency bonus is doubled if it applies to the check.</p>
                <h3>Linnorm Prowess</h3>
                    <p>As magic flows through your body, it causes physical traits of your dragon ancestors to emerge. Starting at 1st level, your hit point maximum increases by 1 and increases by 1 again whenever you gain a level in this class. </p>
                    <p>Additionally, you grow sharp claws that increase in potency as you gain levels using the following progression: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>At 1st Level: Your claws deal 1d4 Slashing </li>
                        <li>At 6th Level: Your claws deal 1d6 Slashing </li>
                        <li>At 14th Level: Your claws deal 1d6 Slashing + extra 1d6 Primal damage </li>
                        <li>At 18th Level: Your claws deal 1d6 Slashing + extra 1d6 that is every element your chosen Linnorm governs. </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Attacks with these claws use your Strength modifier, and you can use your bonus action to make an attack with a claw. These claw attacks are considered magical for the purpose of bypassing resistances. </p>
            <h2>Level 6<hr></h2>
                <h3>Dominance</h3>
                    <p>Starting at 6th level, you can use an ability associated with the Linnorm you have chosen. Using such abilities costs 1 sorcery point, and they only function with hard casted spells.</p>
                    <p style="font-size: 1em;"><b>Crovux - Father's Ire</b></p>
                    <p>As a bonus action, you can mark a target for dominance. Until the start of your next turn, if the target is dealt force damage, they must make a Strength saving throw against DC 8 + your proficiency + your Strength modifier. On a failed save, they are forced to kneel (acting as prone) and cannot recover hit points for 2 rounds. </p>
                    <p style="font-size: 1em;"><b>Vallendrel - Septic Overload</b></p>
                    <p>As a bonus action, you can mark a target for dominance. Until the start of your next turn, if the target is dealt acid or poison damage, they must make a Constitution saving throw DC 8 + your proficiency + your Strength modifier. On a failed save, they are poisoned for 1d4 rounds. If they are already poisoned, all enemies within 5 feet of the target are dealt 1d6 poison damage. </p>
                    <p style="font-size: 1em;"><b>Fone - Absolute Cold</b></p>
                    <p>As a bonus action, you can mark a target for dominance. Until the start of your next turn, if the target is dealt cold damage, they must make a Dexterity saving throw DC 8 + your proficiency + your Strength modifier. On a failed save, they are frozen solid and stunned until the end of their next turn. </p>
                    <p style="font-size: 1em;"><b>Eldos Daikura - Attrition</b></p>
                    <p>As a bonus action, you can mark a target for dominance. Until the start of your next turn, if the target is dealt necrotic damage, the source of the spell cast is healed a number of hit points equal to half the necrotic damage the target takes. </p>
                    <p style="font-size: 1em;"><b>Rhagdas - Overwhelming Flame</b></p>
                    <p>As a bonus action, you can mark a target for dominance. Until the start of your next turn, if the target is dealt fire damage, they must make a Constitution saving throw DC 8 + your proficiency + your Strength modifier. On a failed save, they take an extra 2d12 fire damage. This can only occur once per source or once per claw attack from the Linnorm Prowess class feature.</p>
                    <p style="font-size: 1em;"><b>Draaga - The Bends</b></p>
                    <p>As a bonus action, you can mark a target for dominance. Until the start of your next turn, if the target is dealt lightning damage, they must make a Constitution saving throw DC 8 + your proficiency + your Strength modifier. On a failed save, their lungs begin to fill with water, preventing speech and the ability to cast spells with verbal components for 1d4 rounds.</p>
            <h2>Level 14<hr></h2>
                <h3>Primal Stride</h3>
                    <p>At 14th level, you are under a constant Freedom of Movement effect. </p>
            <h2>Level 18<hr></h2>
                <h3>Ancient Power</h3>
                    <p>Beginning at 18th level, all spells that you hard cast that deal damage can be changed to primal damage. Your Dominance class feature triggers off of primal damage, and each time you defeat an enemy with primal damage you regain 2 sorcery points as long as the enemy is at least half your level.</p>
