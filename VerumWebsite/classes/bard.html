            <h1>Description</h1>
                <p>Humming as she traces her fingers over an ancient monument in a long-forgotten ruin, a half-elf in rugged leathers finds knowledge springing into her mind, conjured forth by the magic of her songâ€”knowledge of the people who constructed the monument and the mythic saga it depicts.</p>
                <p>A stern human warrior bangs his sword rhythmically against his scale mail, setting the tempo for his war chant and exhorting his companions to bravery and heroism. The magic of his song fortifies and emboldens them.</p>   
                <p>Laughing as she tunes her cittern, a gnome weaves her subtle magic over the assembled nobles, ensuring that her companions' words will be well received.</p>  
                <p>Whether scholar, skald, or scoundrel, a bard weaves magic through words and music to inspire allies, demoralize foes, manipulate minds, create illusions, and even heal wounds.</p>
            <h1>Music and Magic</h1>
                <p>In the worlds of D&D, words and music are not just vibrations of air, but vocalizations with power all their own. The bard is a master of song, speech, and the magic they contain. Bards say that the multiverse was spoken into existence, that the words of the gods gave it shape, and that echoes of these primordial Words of Creation still resound throughout the cosmos. The music of bards is an attempt to snatch and harness those echoes, subtly woven into their spells and powers.</p>
                <p>The greatest strength of bards is their sheer versatility. Many bards prefer to stick to the sidelines in combat, using their magic to inspire their allies and hinder their foes from a distance. But bards are capable of defending themselves in melee if necessary, using their magic to bolster their swords and armor. Their spells lean toward charms and illusions rather than blatantly destructive spells. They have a wide-ranging knowledge of many subjects and a natural aptitude that lets them do almost anything well. Bards become masters of the talents they set their minds to perfecting, from musical performance to esoteric knowledge.</p>
            <h1>Learning from Experience</h1>
                <p>True bards are not common in the world. Not every minstrel singing in a tavern or jester cavorting in a royal court is a bard. Discovering the magic hidden in music requires hard study and some measure of natural talent that most troubadours and jongleurs lack. It can be hard to spot the difference between these performers and true bards, though. A bard's life is spent wandering across the land gathering lore, telling stories, and living on the gratitude of audiences, much like any other entertainer. But a depth of knowledge, a level of musical skill, and a touch of magic set bards apart from their fellows.</p>
                <p>Only rarely do bards settle in one place for long, and their natural desire to travelâ€”to find new tales to tell, new skills to learn, and new discoveries beyond the horizonâ€”makes an adventuring career a natural calling. Every adventure is an opportunity to learn, practice a variety of skills, enter long-forgotten tombs, discover lost works of magic, decipher old tomes, travel to strange places, or encounter exotic creatures. Bards love to accompany heroes to witness their deeds firsthand. A bard who can tell an awe-inspiring story from personal experience earns renown among other bards. Indeed, after telling so many stories about heroes accomplishing mighty deeds, many bards take these themes to heart and assume heroic roles themselves.</p>
                <h2 style="text-align: center;">Bards in Verum follow the same rules as Standard 5e. <a style="font-size: inherit;" href="https://5e.tools/classes.html#bard_phb" target="_blank">Official variants</a> are allowed as well as the variant(s) listed below.</h2>
            <h1><em>Jester</em></h1>
                <p><em>The Jester knows the true power of one's sense of self-worth. As such their mockery is deep cutting and destructive.</em></p>
            <h2>Level 3<hr></h2>
                <h3>Scarring Mockery</h3>
                    <p>The Vicious Mockery cantrip is empowered for you. The base damage die of the Vicious Mockery cantrip is now 1d8 and all scaling uses this die as well. This mockery can be empowered further by expending one use of your Bardic Inspiration to roll the die and add the number rolled as extra damage to the cantrip. </p>
            <h3>Gallows Humor</h3>
                <p>Beginning at 3rd level, whenever you take damage from an attack roll, you can choose to mock yourself, adding 1d8 psychic damage to the damage roll. If you do, you can heal an ally within 30 feet for the total damage you take from the attack. This can be used a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once) and replenishes on a short or long rest.</p>
            <h2>Level 6<hr></h2>
                <h3>Taunting Mockery</h3>
                    <p>At 6th level, whenever an enemy fails a saving throw against your Vicious Mockery cantrip, if that enemy's next attack before the end of its next turn is against an ally instead of you, it must make a saving throw against the Vicious Mockery cantrip again. If it fails, the target's attack deals half damage.</p>
            <h2>Level 14<hr></h2>
                <h3>Last Laugh</h3>
                    <p>At 14th level, whenever you are reduced to 0 hit points by an enemy, you can laugh as loud as you are able and expend all of your remaining uses of Bardic Inspiration. Roll the dice and add them together. If you have no Bardic Inspiration uses remaining, you can roll a number of d8s equal to your Charisma modifier instead. Whatever the total number is, it is added to the next damage roll for all of your allies that can see and hear you. If the enemy that defeated you is themselves defeated within 1 round of you using this ability, you are healed for an amount of hit points equal to the total rolled. Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>
