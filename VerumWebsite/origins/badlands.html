        <h1 style="text-decoration: underline; font-size: 2.5em;">The Badlands</h1>
        <h2>Topography</h2>
        <p>The Badlands is a vast wasteland. The remnants of the once great elven empire, reduced to poisonous dust and erratic storms. Clean water is scarce, and food is found mostly in places where those few people—who remain—were able to survive. These locations are what still remains of the farmable land, despite this they still often have to hunt the dangerous creatures or commit acts of cannibalism to survive.</p>
        <h2>Government</h2>
        <p>The Badlands have no established large government, with the only form such existing within the various tribes that roam its wastes.</p>
        <h2>Science / Magic Development</h2>
        <p>The Badlands were previously a thriving empire of bio-magical engineering. Now the Badlands have been reduced to nothing but ash, dust and death. </p>
        <h2>Demographics</h2>
        <p>Creatures like gnolls, orcs and desperate dark elves are the most common of these tribes but there are many forms of misery within this place. </p>
        <h2>Religion</h2>
        <p>For those that still cling to religion within this hopeless place, it should be noted that the gods vary wildly. There are those that pray to the light and those that embrace the dark. In this land of famine and peril, all are welcome. </p>
        <h2>Military</h2>
        <p>While war is no stranger to the Badlands, there are very few that could consider themselves to possess anything resembling a military. Most combat is tribal skirmishes that come to swift, brutal ends. </p>
        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>Once, the badlands was a nearly utopic landscape, filled with plenty and majesty. That all changed when Synonine Twelvestar VII, was betrayed by his son. This one act ended the family line not only in it's governance, but also transformed the son into the first dark elf. The blight from that action spread into the earth, poisoning it and the transformation to what the Badlands is today was swift and merciless. Thousands died within the first few days, either from sickness and desperation. Thousands more from famine and neglect. The elves lost the seat of power and the struggle for what scraps remained fueled a war in Majital that would cost the elves their last home. </p>
        <p>There was however a spark of hope. 60 years after the reckoning, there began an expedition from the elves that followed the old ways. They took the last of the imperial line, to attempt to take back their homeland. Their success is yet to be seen. </p>
        <h2>Economy</h2>
        <p> The only real economy of the Badlands are the excavation and selling of ancient elven artifacts and corpses.</p>
        <h2>Origin Bonus</h2>
        <p>A fallow and vast wasteland of forgotten dreams and broken spirits. The Badlands, aptly named, is home to the exiled, desperate or destitute. However, even in this hopeless and terrible place, there is a light of life. Badlanders are extremely few in number and even less in number are those who leave their broken home. All Badlanders receive the following benefits as well as list of sub-types. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Badlanders are haught and resilent. You gain a +10 to your maximum hitpoints. </li>
            <li>You gain a +2 bonus to all saving throws.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Sub-Origins:</h2>
        <p>Backgrounds in Verum are replaced with an origin and sub-origin. Players select a sub-origin listed below and recived bonuses from both the origin and sub-origin.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="left">
        <h1>Banshee Born</h1>
        <p>Their are few things that send chills down the spines of mortals than the scream of a banshee.The badlands is a place where such creatures prey not only to kill but to steal to seduce men and create a terrible spawn, left to die slowly in the wastes. Not all do. You were one of them. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Whenever you would take a short rest you are healed an amount equal to your constitution modifier.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="left">
        <h1>Doomsayer</h1>
        <p>Dark utterings and whispered warnings plague denizens of the badlands. Some are afflicted worse than others, and these voices pour like a diseased river from the Doomsayer with uncontrolled extremity. Those around them are effected with the endless mutterings. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Whenever you roll a 1 on an attack roll, saving throw or skill check in combat, you are healed for a number of hitpoints equal to your Constitution modifier (The heal takes place after the effect of the roll, e.g you miss and then you are healed, not before).</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="left">
        <h1>Twice Cursed</h1>
        <p>There are those that are considered ill omens among the hopeless. These Twice-Cursed walk with more than their fair share of the curse. Powerful nightmares await them each night and sleep often eludes them. However, within this horrible existence there lies a silver lining. For the more cursed they become, the more powerful they get.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Whenever you receive a penalty to attack rolls, saving throws or AC, you are healed a number of hit points equal to the penalty. This only counts the first time you receive a given penalty in a combat. </li>
            <li>You gain proficiency with Glassblower's Tools.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="left">
        <h1>Wendigo Soul</h1>
        <p>Those born while their mothers are eaten by their fathers, birth the Wendigo Soul. The survival of such a child, a miracle, the life of the adult a curse. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Whenever an enemy you can see within 10ft rolls a 1 on a d20 roll, you are healed for 3 hit points as you feed on the misfortune of others.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="left">
        <h1>Woeful Warrior</h1>
        <p>Sadness can overpower and cripple. Hence why it makes such a potent weapon. Those that dedicate themselves to this vicious art, are feared not for their blade, but for what they leave behind. Misery in an already unhappy world. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Whenever you kill an enemy, you are healed for a number of hitpoints equal to the killed enemy's Constitution modifier (minimum one).</li>
        </ul>
