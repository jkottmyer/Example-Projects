        <h1 style="text-decoration: underline; font-size: 2.5em;">Skinwalkers</h1>
        <h2>Race Description</h2>
        <p>There are many races that call themselves Skinwalkers. These races are all bound by a single event: the curse of Gazenaroc. Save for the lizardfolk, nearly every being that is a mix of man and animal is a skinwalker. The skinwalkers vary as much as their human counterparts. While some have successfully integrated themselves into the world, others live in secluded colonies, hidden from persecution. Although the modern day skinwalkers are not cursed by Gazenaroc, they are born of the same ancestors that were. For long ago, some of humanity did not respect nature. They slaughtered its animals, plundered its forests, and reaped its fields, causing Gazenaroc to become enraged. Inca tried to plead on the humans behalf, saying that they were young and that time would teach them. Gazenaroc conceded and allowed Inca to try to convince them. However, as Inca summoned a contingent of dryads to speak to the humans, they were defiled and destroyed by the lawless bandits with no respect to nature. As the humans celebrated, Inca wept. Gazenaroc, pushed to the brink by his friend’s tears, cursed them all. They would learn to respect nature by becoming a part of it again. And so, the first skinwalkers were born.</p>
        <h2>Racial Information</h2>
        <h3>Anatomy </h3>
        <p>A Skinwalker is any creature that is not mentioned elsewhere that is a crossbreed of a human and an animal. Many kinds exist, some known and some hidden in this world. Such creatures include, but are not limited to; Aarakocra, Tabaxi, Tortles, Kenku, and all manners of lycanthropy.</p>
        <p>Grippli like most humanoids are bipedal, possessing two legs, and two arms.</p>
        <h3>Biological Traits </h3>
        <p>An Aarakocra is type skin of skinwalker that split off and sought isolation within the highest points of the world. The aloofness of elves is matched only by that of the aarakocra. They believe themselves to be above the problems of the ground. As such, many aarakocra only adventure in times of great need, great sorrow, or exile. Within their own history, there were some that fell from the skies to roam the ground. In response, the spirits that they worshipped sought to punish the traitors, turning them into kenku. </p>
        <p>The Kenku are skinwalkers that branched off even further from the aarakocra by taking to the ground. In response, the vengeful spirits of the wind transformed them by stealing their voices and by taking their flight. This led them to wander and to adapt in a new way: by borrowing the voices from all around them. They formed a kind of chameleon society, blending in nearly seamlessly with the other civilizations of the world. The kenku themselves survived mostly by trade of both material goods and overheard secrets. </p>
        <p>Tabaxi are skinwalkers that, in the early times, sought to trade with the other races. Led by their curiosity, charisma, and natural luck, the tabaxi found a place in the world among the other races. Tabaxi tend to take things in stride and live mostly carefree lives. Those that seek adventure do so mostly out of boredom. This whimsical nature, however, makes them prone to addiction. </p>
        <p>The Tortles, much like the lizardfolk, sought the swamps of Dolten for their refuge where they began a slow-moving yet long-lasting culture. Tortles are traditional much to the same caliber of the dwarves and tend to change very little. Those that seek adventure normally do so for redemption. The Tortles’ traditions are long as are their memories, and crimes are never forgotten.</p>
        <p>Gripplis are small humanoids typically resembling tree frogs, and have slight but very agile frames. They stand just over two feet in height, but possess remarkable agility and the ability to climb or swim rapidly. Gripplis are normally brightly coloured like the tropical tree frog they resemble, though their bright colour fades as they age. They typically weigh just over thirty pounds.</p>
        <h3>Genetics and Reproduction </h3>
        <p>Lycanthropy is contracted when bitten, scratched, or otherwise dealt damage by the natural appendage of a lycanthrope. This contraction can only occur when the individual is in a primal state and the curse is strongest. This is why a tabaxi, for example, does not pass the curse to another when they deal damage with their claws. Sometimes, although it is rare, the progeny of a skinwalker can be born as a true lycanthrope. This normally happens whenever a skinwalker crossbreeds with a non-skinwalker.</p>
        <p>Gripplis reproduce via egg laying, and a newly hatched grippli takes less than a year to mature to adult size. Unless they meet a violent end, which considering the dangerous environments they inhabit is very possible, gripplis can live to reach 60 years of age.</p>
        <h3>Ecology and Habitats </h3>
        <p>Skinwalkers can be found in any place that humans can be found, although this is mostly only for those that are an established race. Those that cannot control the beast can be found in isolated colonies within Dolten.</p>
        <h3>Perception and Sensory Capabilities </h3>
        <p>Basic 5, some with heightened sight and scent. Some supernatural senses.</p>
        <h2>Culture</h2>
        <h3>Major Language Groups and Dialects </h3>
        <p>Sylvan (Moon)</p>
        <h3>History </h3>
        <p>Long ago, some of humanity did not respect nature. They slaughtered its animals, plundered its forests, and reaped its fields, causing Gazenaroc to become enraged. Inca tried to plead on the humans behalf, saying that they were young and that time would teach them. Gazenaroc conceded and allowed Inca to try to convince them.

You cannot willingly stop in a space smaller than that, and if forced to do so, you immediately flow to the nearest space you can fit. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus and you regain all uses upon finishing a short or long rest. This ability also grants advantage to escaping manacles (Dexterity check).</li>
                <li><b>Go for the Throat: </b>You are an expert in attacking when people don’t expect it and bite where it most hurts. Once per attack action, when you make a melee weapon attack with advantage and hit, you can deal 1d4 piercing damage to a target within 5 ft. of you that you can see. You do not need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 ft. of it, that enemy is not incapacitated, and you don’t have disadvantage on the attack roll. </li>

            <ul>
                <li><b>Ability Score Racial Traits: </b>A Seishin increases their Charisma score by 1. </li>
                <li><b>Will-o-wisp: </b>As a bonus action, you can call forth a mote of light to follow you, one for each tail you have. These motes occupy the same space as you and emit 20 ft. dim light. As an action, you can combine all motes together to make a target you can see within 30 ft. of you. This target must make a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw. Upon failure, the target takes 1d6 + your Charisma modifier of Radiant damage, and half as much on a successful one. Multiple motes do not increase damage. You must re-summon the motes after having made an attack with them. If you have multiple attacks within an attack action, this replaces one of them. </li>
                <li><b>Clandestine : </b>You are able to hide the fact that you are a Kitsune and Skinwalker, and instead appear Human. As an action, you can magically hide your ears, fur, and tail(s), and visually replace them with human equivalents. You may drop the illusion as a free action.</li>

        <p><b>Age: </b>Witchwolves tend to live slightly shorter lives than humans. The average life expectancy is around 60 years.</p>
        <p><b>Alignment: </b>Being a skinwalker can make living and fitting in to traditional society rather difficult. Witchwolves tend toward chaotic and neutral alignments because of this, but they have no innate disposition toward an alignment.</p>
        <p><b>Senses: </b>A lineage of night hunters has given you excellent hunting senses. You gain 60 ft. Darkvision and gain a Scent sense with a range of 30 ft. </p>

                <li><b>Subdue Prey: </b>If you move 20 feet straight towards a target and then grapple the target successfully immediately afterwards, both you and the target become prone (the target is still grappled). </li>
                <li><b>Frenzied Howl: </b>A snarling, ferocious howl erupts from you as an action. All hostile creatures within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw against DC 12 + proficiency or be frightened of you for 1 minute. They can repeat this save at the end of each of their turns. After using this ability, your movement speed is increased by 10 feet for the next minute. Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest. </li>
            </ul>

                <li><b>Hunter’s Howl: </b>As an action, you let loose a low and keening howl. For the next minute, your Scent range increases by 30 feet, allowing you to know the exact location of every creature at less than their maximum hit points within this Scent radius. Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.</li>

        <p><b>Size: </b>Medium</p>
        <p><b>Speed: </b>30 feet, climb 20 feet</p>
        <p><b>Age: </b>Tabaxi have lifespans equivalent to humans. </p>
        <p><b>Alignment: </b>Tabaxi tend toward chaotic alignments, as they let impulse and fancy guide their decisions. They are rarely evil, with most of them driven by curiosity rather than greed or other dark impulses. </p>
        <p><b>Size: </b>Tabaxi are taller on average than humans and relatively slender. Your size is Medium. </p>
        <p><b>Darkvision: </b>You have a cat's keen senses, especially in the dark. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. </p>
        <p><b>Feline Agility: </b>Your reflexes and agility allow you to move with a burst of speed. When you move on your turn in combat, you can double your speed until the end of the turn. Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you move 0 feet on one of your turns. </p>
        <p><b>Cat's Claws: </b>Because of your claws, you have a climbing speed of 20 feet. In addition, your claws are natural weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with them, you deal slashing damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike. </p>

        <h1 id="tortle">Tortle</h1>
        <p><b>Ability Score Increase: </b>Strength +2, Wisdom +1</p>
        <p><b>Size: </b>Medium</p>
        <p><b>Speed: </b>30 feet</p>
        <p><b>Age: </b>Young tortles crawl for a few weeks after birth before learning to walk on two legs. They reach adulthood by the age of 15 and live an average of 50 years. </p>
        <p><b>Alignment: </b>Tortles tend to lead orderly, ritualistic lives. They develop customs and routines, becoming more set in their ways as they age. Most are lawful good. A few can be selfish and greedy, tending more toward evil, but it's unusual for a tortle to shuck off order in favor of chaos. </p>
        <p><b>Size: </b>Tortle adults stand 5 to 6 feet tall and average 450 pounds. Their shells account for roughly one-third of their weight. Your size is Medium </p>
        <p><b>Claws: </b>Your claws are natural weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with them, you deal slashing damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength modifier, instead of bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike. </p>
        <p><b>Hold Breath: </b>You can hold your breath for up to 1 hour at a time. Tortles aren't natural swimmers, but they can remain underwater for some time before needing to come up for air. </p>
        <p><b>Natural Armor: </b>Due to your shell and the shape of your body, you are ill-suited to wearing armor. Your shell provides ample protection, however; it gives you a base AC of 17 (your Dexterity modifier doesn't affect this number). You gain no benefit from wearing armor, but if you are using a shield, you can apply the shield's bonus as normal. </p>
        <p><b>Shell Defense: </b>You can withdraw into your shell as an action. Until you emerge, you gain a +4 bonus to AC, and you have advantage on Strength and Constitution saving throws. While in your shell, you are prone, your speed is 0 and can't increase, you have disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws, you can't take reactions, and the only action you can take is a bonus action to emerge from your shell. </p>
        <p><b>Survival Instinct: </b>You gain proficiency in the Survival skill. Tortles have finely honed survival instincts. </p>
        <p><b>Languages: </b>You can speak, read, and write Aquan and Common</p>
