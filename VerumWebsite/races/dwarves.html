        <h1 style="text-decoration: underline; font-size: 2.5em;">Dwarves</h1>
        <h2>Race Description</h2>
        <p>In the first era, as the Lizardfolk retreated to their mystic jungles and the elves spread across the rest of the surface, it was the dwarves that took their home in the mountains and the unknown wonders below. It was here that the dwarves developed the art of forging, of trade, of travel; their culture. So deep did the dwarves dig, that another world was made. A world formed from the caverns and crevices from below the surface. It was here, in the depths of the dark, that the dwarves longed to see the light above, but would not abandon what they had created. And so one among them, who would soon become their king, crafted for them this light out of a mysterious metal found within the deepest part of the earth. It was here that Astaroth created the Dark Sun. </p>
        <p>This sun forged in the dark brought light, wealth, and energy to the dwarves deep below. But there were some who saw; some who believed that the light of this sun carried with it a great cost, for dwarves under it began to form ashen skin. They began to forget the old kingdom and the old hymns. Astaroth looked down upon his people, not with a soft hand, but a hard one. He believed that iron was better than the soft flesh, and thus he ruled with a fist of iron. It was then that the dwarves of Krazax abandoned their underworld kin. As they departed to the surface, it was they that sealed the Deep Gate in the hopes that Astaroth and all that followed him would not threaten the surface or the peaceful people of the mountains. </p>
        <p>In the next era, the dwarves of Krazax flourished, and spread throughout what is known as modern Krazax. Here the mountain kingdoms flourished and prospered. However, this peace was occasionally interrupted by wars with the goblinoid tribes and the tyrannical giants. Here the dwarves withstood the test of time building great structures, producing immortal art, weapons, armor, and machinery. It was here, during this time, that the dwarves witnessed the confrontation between the elves, dragons, and Lizardfolk. The dwarves remained isolated within their mountain homes, perfectly context with the other races warring with another. Peace was attempted, but a betrayal was committed. A meeting between the dwarves, elves, and all leaders of the minor races were betrayed by poison and conspiracy. And thus the enmity between the dwarves and elves was manifested.</p>
        <h2>Racial Information</h2>
        <h3>Anatomy</h3>
        <p>Dwarves have short statures and abnormally hairy bodies. </p>
        <p>Duergar are dwarves that chose to stay behind with Astaroth during the great exodus to the surface. Their exposure to the Dark Sun have granted them many gifts. They possess innate magics and superior darkvision. In addition, Astaroth’s teachings have made them resilient to hardship and inefficiency. However, it is difficult for them to see in the light of the true sun. </p>
        <p>Mountain dwarves are the most common form of dwarf found within the mountain kingdoms and that most look to when one thinks of dwarves. The most iconic part of mountain dwarves are their dedication to their beards, which has led to the stereotype of a dwarf’s beard. Their beards are often braided, bejeweled, adorned, and otherwise stylized heavily. </p>
        <p>Hill dwarves are much like mountain dwarves accept that they live in the hilly terrain in the lowlands of Krazax among their human neighbors. These dwarves tend to style their beards similarly to their human neighbors, whether whimsical or fantastical, with large mustaches. While their mountain kin focus more on the forge, hill dwarves tend to focus more on the trade that the forge produces.</p>
        <h3>Genetics and Reproduction</h3>
        <p>Between Dwarves and Humans</p>
        <h3>Growth Rate and Stages</h3>
        <p>Dwarves live roughly 300-400 years old, dependent on several factors. Dwarves are physically mature at the age of 13 except for their beards. Their beards reach a full length around age 50, which is culturally when a dwarf is considered an adult. While female dwarves do not have beards, a similar outlook is goes to their hair.</p>
        <h3>Ecology and Habitats</h3>
        <p>As one of the trading races, dwarves can be found in many places. However, they tend to congregate mostly in Krazax. Dwarves tend to be found around large trading centers or cities with large markets. Dwarves tend to be a pragmatic people and can be found in unsavory places as well.</p>
        <h3>Dietary Needs and Habits </h3>
        <p>Omnivorous</p>
        <h3>Social Structure </h3>
        <p>The Dwarves tend to have a positive view on their lives. They focus instead on tradition, which they hope will supply all races with the wisdom that such a long life can give.</p>
        <h3>Facial characteristics </h3>
        <p>Short startue and busy hair/beards.</p>
        <h3>Geographic Origin and Distribution </h3>
        <p>As one of the trading races, dwarves can be found in many places. However, they tend to congregate mostly in Krazax. Dwarves tend to be found around large trading centers or cities with large markets. Dwarves tend to be a pragmatic people and can be found in unsavory places as well.</p>
