        <h1 style="text-decoration: underline; font-size: 2.5em;">Gnomes</h1>
        <h2>Race Description</h2>
        <p>Gnomes are a curious race, they themselves were not born of the world like the other races, but rather within the veil beyond, within the realm of dreams. The first gnomes were simply dreamed up, a collection of errant thoughts that morphed from the dreamscape, when these being were first ‘born’ they themselves grew lonely and dreamed up more and more. They were all of them however, not truly alive, so Oun and Wode, gave them passage into the real world, so that they too, might truly live.</p>
        <h2>Racial Information</h2>
        <h3>Anatomy</h3>
        <p>Gnomes are beings that exist in the world normally, but they are also possessed of dream stuff, their innate magic and whimsical lifestyles are a tribute to their origin. They are small, like halflings, possessing wild hairstyles and colors, their eyes are often different colors and their skin has even been known to change color. Gnomes are very much a product of their surroundings, as such things affect their inner dream and that in turn affects their physical body. </p>
        <p>Rock gnomes are those that sought refuge with the dwarves. The dwarves taught them to craft and they took to it easily, their powerful imaginations and clever minds quickly pacing up to the dwarves and, although they will not admit it easily, surpassed them, in some areas. Rock gnomes dream of clocks, cogs and all manner of machinery. They dream of practical things to make life easier and in times of war, harder for their enemies. </p>
        <p>Forest gnomes are those that sought refuge among nature when they first came into the world. Following the ways of the druids of old, the forest gnomes were able to establish themselves in the dreaming veil of the animals and plants of the world. They dream of beautiful things, a colorful meadow, a babbling brook and warm breeze. It was in these dreams that the forest gnomes developed the ability to talk to animals as well. </p>
        <p>Svirfneblin are gnomes that took to the badlands and entered only misery, nearly hunted down in these terrible lands to extinction, it was then that Wode sought to guide them and taught them the wisdom in the dark, the power of fear and the lord of nightmares gained his chosen people. Svirfneblin today can be found anywhere, living their lives, unafraid of the dark. Mostly nocturnal, these being sleep during the day and walk the night, which they view as sacred. Most Svirfneblin worship Wode, although an extremely rare few seek other gods.</p>
        <h3>Biological Traits </h3>
        <p>Gnomes are beings that exist in the world normally, but they are also possessed of dream stuff, their innate magic and whimsical lifestyles are a tribute to their origin. They are small, like halflings, possessing wild hairstyles and colors, their eyes are often different colors and their skin has even been known to change color. Gnomes are very much a product of their surroundings, as such things affect their inner dream and that in turn affects their physical body.</p>
        <h3>Genetics and Reproduction </h3>
        <p>Although they procreate as normal humanoids, it is believed that each gnome soul is crafted by the dreams of their parents and as such, each gnome possesses a ‘mother’ dream which is often associated with their own personality, this in turn changes as they experience life.</p>
        <h3>Ecology and Habitats </h3>
        <p>Forests, Underground, the badlands.</p>
        <h3>Dietary Needs and Habits </h3>
        <p>Omnivorous</p>
        <h3>Biological Cycle </h3>
        <p>Gnomes themselves are technically immortal, they cannot die of old age, nor do they even truly age, a gnome, as it lives, experiences more and more, but so to does it’s dream grow more and more enticing. A gnome leaves this world and returns to the spirit realm whenever it has nothing new to experience, whether by circumstance, isolation or a very long life. This means that a gnome can actually die from loneliness or imprisonment.</p>
        <h3>Average Intelligence </h3>
        <p>10-12</p>
        <h3>Perception and Sensory Capabilities </h3>
        <p>The Basic 5 with some possessing enhanced sight.</p>
        <h2>Culture</h2>
        <h3>Major Language Groups and Dialects </h3>
        <p>Gnomish</p>
        <h3>History </h3>
        <p>Long ago, in a time of great need, when the magic of the world was threatened and war was to consume all of Kalkatesh, it was the gnomes who pleaded with Oun and Wode, begging them to help the waking realm. Arcane magic had all but diminished due to the many wars of the past, as such, Kalkatesh was ill equipped to deal with the invasions of the planar wars. So Wode and Oun made a deal with the gnomes, they would allow the dream of magic be made real into the waking realm, they would help this dream come true, but it would come with a price. So it was then, a large majority of gnomes, re-entered the dream, ending their lives, but dreaming of a world where magic has returned. As such the arcane pillar was restored and magic made whole. 3 eras hence, the gnomish population has only recovered to about half of what it was, but the Martyr’s Dream remains intact, a pity that this gift has all but been wasted as once more the arcane pillar is in jeopardy.</p>

        <p><b>Alignment: </b>Gnomes are most often good. Those who tend toward law are sages, engineers, researchers, scholars, investigators, or inventors.

        <p><b>Darkvision: </b>Accustomed to life underground, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. </p>
        <p><b>Gnome Cunning: </b>You have advantage on all Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving throws against magic. </p>

        <p><b>Languages: </b>You can speak, read, and write Common and Gnomish. The Gnomish language, which uses the Dwarvish script, is renowned for its technical treatises and its catalogs of knowledge about the natural world. </p>

Using those tools, you can spend 1 hour and 10 gp worth of materials to construct a Tiny clockwork device (AC 5, 1 hp).

        <ul>
            <li><b>Clockwork Toy: </b>This toy is a clockwork animal, monster, or person, such as a frog, mouse, bird, dragon, or soldier.

        <p><b>Ability Score Increase: </b>Intelligence +2, Dexterity +1</p>
        <p><b>Size: </b>Small</p>
        <p><b>Speed: </b>25 feet</p>
        <p><b>Age: </b>Svirfneblin are short-lived for gnomes. They mature at the same rate humans do and are considered full-grown adults by 25. They live 200 to 250 years, although hard toil and the dangers of the Underdark often claim them before their time. </p>
        <p><b>Alignment: </b>Svirfneblin believe that survival depends on avoiding entanglements with other creatures and not making enemies, so they favor neutral alignments. They rarely wish others ill, and they are unlikely to take risks on behalf of others. </p>
        <p><b>Size: </b>A typical svirfneblin stands about 3 to 3½ feet tall and weighs 80 to 120 pounds. Your size is Small. </p>
        <p><b>Superior Darkvision: </b>Accustomed to life underground, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 120 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. </p>
        <p><b>Gnome Cunning: </b>You have advantage on all Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving throws against magic. </p>
        <p><b>Stone Camouflage: </b>You have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks to hide in rocky terrain. </p>
        <p><b>Languages: </b>You can speak, read, and write Common, Gnomish and Undercommon. The svirfneblin dialect is more guttural than surface Gnomish, and most svirfneblin know only a little bit of Common, but those who deal with outsiders (and that includes you as an adventurer) pick up enough Common to get by in other lands.</p>
