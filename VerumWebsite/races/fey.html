        <h2>Race Description</h2>
        <p>A changeling is born between the machinations of a hag and a mortal man. Changelings are always female and are constantly hounded by the call of their hag mothers' their entire lives.</p>
        <h2>Racial Information</h2>
        <h3>Anatomy</h3>
        <p>Changelings are on average the same size as humans. They are, however, shapechangers and can assume the appearance of any humanoid creature they have seen.</p>
        <h3>Biological Traits </h3>
        <p>Changelings can shapeshift into any humanoid that they have seen, but revert to their true form - a greyish sort of featureless creature - if they die.</p>
        <h3>Genetics and Reproduction</h3>
        <p>Changelings are always female.</p>
        <h3>Growth Rate and Stages </h3>
        <p>Changelings reach maturity at the age of 15 and live to about 110 years old.</p>
        <h3>Ecology and Habitats</h3>
        <p>Changelings can be found living anywhere other humanoids are, especially as they have the ability to shapeshift.</p>
        <h3>Dietary Needs and Habits </h3>
        <p>Omnivorous</p>
        <h3>Social Structure</h3>
        <p>Changelings can conform to a variety of social structures and are adept at doing so by design.</p>
        <h3>Facial characteristics </h3>
        <p>Variable</p>
        <h3>Average Intelligence </h3>
        <p>10-12</p>
        <h3>Perception and Sensory Capabilities </h3>
        <p>The basic five, and the ability to see in the dark.</p>
        <h2>Culture</h2>
        <h3>Culture and Cultural Heritage </h3>
        <p>Changelings are a race of creatures that blend in to other cultures and rarely have a traditional family - that they know of - so they have an almost non-existent racial identity.</p>
        <h3>History </h3>
        <p>Changelings were created from the machinations between hags and mortal man. The role of a changeling is to serve their hag mothers by luring humans back to the swamps where these hags live to create more changelings. A changeling will always attempt to resist the call of their mothers to return to the swamp once their mission has been completed.</p>

        <p><b>Alignment: </b>Most changelings are neutral. They prefer to keep their presence a secret and often do not take passionate stances that would draw attention to them. However, changelings can be any alignment, and often readily adapt to the culture they are raised in. </p>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Ram: </b>Constitution +1 - These horns grant the satyr the ability to charge opponents with their horns.

        <h2>Race Description</h2>
        <p>Small humanoid like creatures, Sprites are creatures from the Feywild. Sprites can be defined by traditional humanoids by the distinctive set of wings they possess.</p>
        <h2>Racial Information</h2>
        <h3>Anatomy</h3>
        <p>Barely larger than some small beasts, Sprites make up for this with wings that allow them a mastery of flight.</p>
        <h3>Biological Traits </h3>
        <p>Sprites are barely as large as young human children and thus simply cannot wear some armor or wield some weapons that larger humanoid creatures might easily be able to.</p>
        <h3>Growth Rate and Stages </h3>
        <p>The magical essence of the fey grants Sprites a decent lifespan, they gain maturity at 7 years and live as long as 150 years.</p>
