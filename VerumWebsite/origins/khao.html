        <h1 style="text-decoration: underline; font-size: 2.5em;">Khao</h1>
        <p><em>Khao is a twin existence, one being the great jungle below, the other the great floating city. The jungle below is comprised of rivers, mountain s and lush green flora. The city is comprised of heavily regulated districts, each with its own various mark.</em></p>
        <h2>Demographics</h2>
        <p>Khao is truly diverse comparatively with the rest of the world. Some would consider them morally corrupt—the corruption not based on race, gender, nor religion, but rather wealth. There is a slight surplus of humans and lizardfolk.</p>
        <h2>Government</h2>
        <p>Khao in both its forms are ruled by the Coin Lords; however, there is also a council of elders which governs the tribes below. The city of Khao uses it's considerable wealth to provide food, shelter and security to their ground walking brethren. With this odd exception Khao is ruled as an oligarchy.</p>
        <h2>Defences</h2>
        <p>The Khaon military is comprised of their native brethren when needed; however, it is mostly reliant on the glorious airship armada that not only protects the city but is also part of the city. </p>
        <p>Within the city are guards employed by the Coin Lord called the Sky Knights, who use gliding and mounts to traverse the city quickly in the sake of rescuing any denizen that may accidentally go over the many edges and gaps of the floating city and prevent their freefall towards the ground far below.</p>
        <h2>Industry and Trade </h2>
        <p>The Economy of Khao is a multi-varied web of intricacy. It is comprised of several treaties which deal with the various countries of the world—selling anything from transportation, slavery to angelic boons. The Great Bazaar is a world power in which nearly all wealth can trace a connection to in some manner.</p>
        <h2>Infrastructure</h2>
        <p>Khao is a shining example of technological advancement, specifically in the field of flight (obviously) and in the general application of alchemical engines. With the possible exception of Bleak, no other city or country has come close to the advancement of Khao. Their advancements include alchemical lighting, food preservation, beverage cooling and various other minor conveniences.</p>
        <h2>Assets</h2>
        <p>All religions are welcome within Khao as long as they pay their taxes and do not cause undo destruction or misery.</p>
        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>560 years ago, Khao was simply a jungle filled with tribes that warred with one another, that was until one day when ancient ruins were discovered by the Khaons. These ruins contained knowledge and indeed magical enhancements for the mind, in just a short time, the Khoans advanced to the levels of capable flight and in a time of great war that ravaged Kalkatesh. The Khaons decided that they would take up an isolation policy enforced by a truly lofty project. The floating city, for within the clouds they would be unchallenged and unmolested—but what to do with all the population—for the great city could not fit them all. The elders believed the fairest way was pure chance and so a series of random allotments were decided, these people would be those that would ascend to the heavens while the rest would stay below. Much to the surprise of those in power, not a single soul attempted to cheat, the allotments were made and the people that were unified in knowledge would now be separated by distance. The people of Khao are stronger knit than most so it was agreed by those in the sky that they would always care for those below; that as their fleet grew larger, they would land and gather the tribes. The eventual goal of the Khaons is to ascend all of their people. So they have kept to that promise for these 500 years.</p>
        <h2>Origin Bonus</h2>
        <p>600 or so years in the past Khao gathered its citizens and rose up into the sky in a single flying mega city. These years hence most citizens hail from this mega city, although a few were born within the jungles of the lands Khao left behind. The following are abilities that all Khaons share and one specific one that depend on whether they are from sky or jungle. As well as a list of sub-types. </p>
        <p>Whether of sky or jungle all Khaons possess inquisitive and curious minds, which give them a natural aptitude for alchemy and the science therein. As such whether repairing alchemical engines of airships or a medical paste from the right flowers in the jungle, you gain Skill Prof – Nature.</p>
        <p>The following ability is where the two kinds of Khaons differ. You may choose one of the following: 
            <ul>
                <li>City – City born Khaons have learned to speak with charm and persuasion. You gain a +1 to Charisma</li>
                <li>Jungle – Jungle born Khaons have learned that instinct is the key to life. You gain a +1 to Wisdom.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h2>Sub-Origins:</h2>
        <p>Backgrounds in Verum are replaced with an origin and sub-origin. Players select a sub-origin listed below and recived bonuses from both the origin and sub-origin.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="left">
        <h1>Dark One</h1>
        <p>Khaoans have the most religious freedom compared to the other countries. All worship is welcome within its borders, even the more insidiously oriented ones. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>You may choose two tenets required by your class. You have the option to not follow those tenets, but you may not actively work against your order or faith. </li>
            <li>Skill Prof – Religion</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="left">
        <h1>Druid In-Training</h1>
        <p>Whether it be in the sky or within the jungle, Druids find these frontiers a training ground for new recruits. The fury of nature is evident to these individuals and often they are drawn to protect and wield the power of nature. Whether or not you become a druid, their power stays with you. </p>
        <p>You may have taken another path, but the power of the druid and their secrets stay with you, and you are attuned with the animals of the wild. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>You gain a cantrip from the Druid spell list and cast it at character level. </li>
            <li>You gain proficiency in the Animal Handling skill, and with an Herbalism Kit.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="left">
        <h1>Enforcer</h1>
        <p>Those that guard against the wayward man or beast are trained well in the arts of combat. To protect their tribe or ship, some things remain the same. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Increase your jump height to 20ft. You have advantage on Acrobatics checks for attempting such jumps. </li>
            <li>You have trained yourself in weapons to protect those under your charge. You gain Skill Prof – Martial.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="left">
        <h1>Exile</h1>
        <p>Teamwork and community are strong concepts to all Khaons, even the evil-inclined respect such a thing. However, there are those, through right or wrong, guilty or innocent, break these tenets of community. As such, they receive the harshest punishment one can receive: Banishment. </p>
        <p>Since you're an exile, you have learned to become self-sufficient.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Spells you cast that target only yourself have three times the duration as normal. This only effects spells that last more than 1 round. </li>
            <li>You gain proficiency in the Survival skill, and with a Poisoner's Kit.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="left">
        <h1>Forager</h1>
        <p>Foragers often serve their tribe or ship as the healer and consumable expert. Using their potent training, they can create potions to heal and poisons to harm easily. They keep watch over those in their care and see to it that the wounded might see another day and their enemy does not. </p>
        <p>Herbs and minerals are powerful tools in your hands. Whether in the whispers of the sky or the growls of the jungle, those that rest in your care face the morning more refreshed.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>When you use a healing kit to stabilize a creature, you restore 1d4 hit points to that creature. If you use the action from the Healer feat, you heal the target for an additional 1d10 hit points. </li>
            <li>You gain proficiency in the Medicine skill, and with Alchemist's Supplies.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="left">
        <h1>Mender</h1>
        <p>Due to the constant wear and tear of the Jungle on structures, those that are able to repair are in high demand. Whether you're a bespectacled alchemist carefully measuring fuel deposits or a simple basket weaver repairing a thatched roof, both have the calling to fix things. </p>
        <p>You can fix anything given enough time!</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You know the Mending cantrip, except you can cast it as an action, and at character level. </li>
            <li>You gain proficiency in the Investigation skill, and with Tinker's Tools.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="left">
        <h1>Tracker</h1>
        <p>Whether by tracing the currents of the wind or the flow of the land, there are those that serve their tribe or city, by guiding the way through the frontier. Apt hunters and able guides, these few are as reliable in losing your way as they are in a fight. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Whether it be hidden in the cloud-lands or within the jungles below, you are adept at finding your pray. You gain Skill Prof – Survival.</li>
            <li>The wilds of the sky and the jungle have taught you not to fear heights. You have resistance to falling damage and suffer no damage from falls of 30ft or less. </li>
        </ul>
