        <div id="classdescription">
            <h1>Description</h1>
                <p>Signaling for her companions to wait, a halfling creeps forward through the dungeon hall. She presses an ear to the door, then pulls out a set of tools and picks the lock in the blink of an eye. Then she disappears into the shadows as her fighter friend moves forward to kick the door open.</p>
                <p>A human lurks in the shadows of an alley while his accomplice prepares for her part in the ambush. When their target—a notorious slaver—passes the alleyway, the accomplice cries out, the slaver comes to investigate, and the assassin's blade cuts his throat before he can make a sound.</p>
                <p>Suppressing a giggle, a gnome waggles her fingers and magically lifts the key ring from the guard's belt. In a moment, the keys are in her hand, the cell door is open, and she and her companions are free to make their escape.</p>
                <p>Rogues rely on skill, stealth, and their foes' vulnerabilities to get the upper hand in any situation. They have a knack for finding the solution to just about any problem, demonstrating a resourcefulness and versatility that is the cornerstone of any successful adventuring party.</p>
            <h1>Skill and Precision</h1>
                <p>Rogues devote as much effort to mastering the use of a variety of skills as they do to perfecting their combat abilities, giving them a broad expertise that few other characters can match. Many rogues focus on stealth and deception, while others refine the skills that help them in a dungeon environment, such as climbing, finding and disarming traps, and opening locks.</p>
                <p>When it comes to combat, rogues prioritize cunning over brute strength. A rogue would rather make one precise strike, placing it exactly where the attack will hurt the target most, than wear an opponent down with a barrage of attacks. Rogues have an almost supernatural knack for avoiding danger, and a few learn magical tricks to supplement their other abilities.</p>
            <h1>A Shady Living</h1>
                <p>Every town and city has its share of rogues. Most of them live up to the worst stereotypes of the class, making a living as burglars, assassins, cutpurses, and con artists. Often, these scoundrels are organized into thieves' guilds or crime families. Plenty of rogues operate independently, but even they sometimes recruit apprentices to help them in their scams and heists. A few rogues make an honest living as locksmiths, investigators, or exterminators, which can be a dangerous job in a world where dire rats—and wererats—haunt the sewers.</p>
                <p>As adventurers, rogues fall on both sides of the law. Some are hardened criminals who decide to seek their fortune in treasure hoards, while others take up a life of adventure to escape from the law. Some have learned and perfected their skills with the explicit purpose of infiltrating ancient ruins and hidden crypts in search of treasure.</p>
                <h2 style="text-align: center;">Rogues in Verum follow the same rules as Standard 5e. <a style="font-size: inherit;" href="https://5e.tools/classes.html#rogue_phb" target="_blank">Official variants</a> are allowed as well as the variant(s) listed below.</h2>
            <h1><em>Gregorian</em></h1>
                <p><em>Those in service to the church, often must use less than holy means to accomplish their objectives, this is where the Gregorian is used.</em></p>
            <h2>Level 3<hr></h2>
                <h3>True Believer</h3>
                    <p>Starting at 3rd level, choose a Deity to serve and one of their domains to follow. You gain the Church Boon and lip service to that Deity. You may change this Deity and domain once per level up. Divinity needs to approve your change of gods. In addition, you can cast a 1st level spell provided by your chosen domain's spells. You use your Intelligence as the spell ability modifier, and spells you cast from this are hard cast. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest. </p>
                    <p>At 5th level, you can also cast a 2nd level spell provided by your chosen domain's spells. You use your Intelligence as the spell ability modifier, and spells you cast from this are hard cast. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest. </p>
                    <p>At 7th level, you can also cast a 3rd level spell provided by your chosen domain's spells. You use your Intelligence as the spell ability modifier, and spells you cast from this are hard cast. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest. </p>
                    <p>At 9th level, you can also cast a 4th level spell provided by your chosen domain's spells. You use your Intelligence as the spell ability modifier, and spells you cast from this are hard cast. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest. </p>
                <h3>Sectless Faith</h3>
                    <p>At 3rd level, you may use the channel divinity class feature of your chosen domain as a cleric of equal level to your levels in rogue. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.  </p>
            <h2>Level 9<hr></h2>
                <h3>Pantheonic Faith</h3>
                    <p>At 9th level, you gain an additional use of your channel divinity class feature. However, you can now use any channel divinity from any deity that your deity shares a pantheon with. </p>
            <h2>Level 13<hr></h2>
                <h3>Dogmatic Dillitante </h3>
                    <p>At 13th level, you have advantage on faith checks. In addition you add an additional +3 to such checks. </p>
            <h2>Level 17<hr></h2>
                <h3>Zealotry</h3>
                    <p>At 17th level, you gain an additional use of your channel divinity class feature. You may also now choose to use your channel divinity class feature to change your sneak attack dice from d6 to d12 for 1 minute. In addition, you can cast the Revivify spell, providing the required spell components. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>
            <h1><em>Pirate</em></h1>
                <p><em>The seas are a dangerous place for a minnow like you, kid. I’m a shark, so if you don't want to get eaten, you better have some gold to give me.</em></p>
            <h2>Bonus Proficiencies</h2>
            <p>When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with the navigators tools and cartographers tools. If you become a member of the Freemen, you gain a +2 on these rolls for as long as you are in the faction. </p>
            <h2>Level 3<hr></h2>
                <h3>Plunder and Thunder</h3>
                    <p>When you choose this archetype 3rd level, you gain an additional 10% wealth when you find a treasure hoard. This stacks with other hoard modifiers. </p>
                    <p>In addition, as a bonus action, you can mark an enemy for death. For 1 minute, you deal sneak attack damage to that creature regardless of circumstances. However, the creature has advantage on attack rolls against you. If this creature is defeated within the minute of this ability, Kaheeli rewards your audacity - you gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls for the remainder of the combat encounter. You can use this ability multiple times in the same combat encounter. However, each time the bonus stacks while benefiting from this bonus, each creature you mark has this bonus to attack you as well. Once the combat encounter in which this ability is used ends, you must finish long rest before you can use it again. </p>
            <h2>Level 9<hr></h2>
                <h3>One more Drink!</h3>
                    <p>Beginning at 9th level, you become an adept at drinking in combat, you can consume potions as a bonus action (this doesn't apply to oils). In addition, while wielding a potion, a tankard of ale, wine, mead, grog, or something similar, you can treat the item as a shield, gaining a +2 to AC. </p>
            <h2>Level 13<hr></h2>
                <h3>Blasted and Blasting</h3>
                    <p>Starting at 13th level, whenever you would receive a critical hit from an enemy, you can use a reaction to attack them back with a melee weapon. If the enemy's attack is a ranged attack, you can switch to a ranged weapon, dropping what you had in your hands to equip it, and make an attack against them. This attack can score a critical hit on a roll of 16-20. </p>
                    <p>You are immune to negative effects of being drunk. </p>
            <h2>Level 17<hr></h2>
                <h3>Edge of the World</h3>
                    <p>At 17th level, you have seen so much, and now this knowledge shows you Kaheeli’s secrets. You are immune to mind-affecting effects, and you gain advantage on saving throws versus all environmental effects, be them magical or mundane.</p>
