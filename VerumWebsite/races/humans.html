        <h1 style="text-decoration: underline; font-size: 2.5em;">Humans</h1>
        <h2>Race Description</h2>
        <p>The humans are a very strange sort who were originally created not in the traditional manner that most races are, but rather created by the dragons. The intent of this creation was twofold. First, for the humans to be able to breed and multiply; and second, to be used as a sort of fodder force, one that would mitigate the constant struggle against the elves and other older races. During this time, the humans slowly began to develop their own various cultures as they were held captive in many different places where the dragons lived. They began to start their own nations, but it was not until Cassius rising above with the help of Runethares did mankind finally move. But now humanity was faced with a very strange problem – they'd have to find their own place in a world not used to them. Humans could be of any walk of life, of any disposition and believe a whole matter of different believes. A human is just as likely to be your friend as they are just as likely to be your enemy and sometimes even both. Although they possess short life spans, they are able to accomplish so much that many other races hide a thin jealously of how they spend their lives.</p>
        <h2>Racial Information</h2>
        <h3>Anatomy</h3>
        <p>Bipedal creatures with the inherent genetic potential to interbreed and adapt to nearly any terrain, climate or danger if given enough time.</p>
        <h3>Biological Traits </h3>
        <p>Humans come in all shapes and sizes, including some humans on the extreme end of both sides of any given measurements. Many humans have traces of other races in their biology, and some even have features descended from dragons and other monstrous races.</p>
        <h3>Genetics and Reproduction </h3>
        <p>Humans possess an innate fertility that is often times the subject of many mysteries. Humans are able to procreate and mix their blood lines with all manner of different species, particularly humanoids and some non-humanoids, while this is considered taboo and some human cultures do not discuss it. It is, nevertheless a biological fact of these mixtures of humanity have led to the formation of half-elves, orcs, dwarves and all manner of other forms of life. It is believed that this is because of the dragons design to make them easily replenishable.</p>
        <h3>Growth Rate & Stages </h3>
        <p>Humans reach adulthood in their late teens and generally live less than a century.</p>

        <h3>Geographic Origin and Distribution </h3>

        <h3>Average Intelligence </h3>
        <p>10</p>

        <p>Varies by region</p>
        <h3>Major Organizations </h3>
        <p>Most organizations that are not defined by non-human racial heritage comprise of many humans.</p>
        <h3>Beauty Ideals </h3>
        <p>Varies based on location. Humans tend to have the most loosely defined idea of beauty.</p>
        <h3>Courtship Ideals </h3>
        <p>Varies based on location.</p>
        <h3>Relationship Ideals </h3>
        <p>Humans possess an innate fertility that is often times the subject of many mysteries. Humans are able to procreate and mix their blood lines with all manner of different species, particularly humanoids and some non-humanoids, while this is considered taboo and some human cultures do not discuss it. It is, nevertheless a biological fact of these mixtures of humanity have led to the formation of half-elves, orcs, dwarves and all manner of other forms of life. It is believed that this is because of the dragons design to make them easily replinishable.</p>
        <h3>Major Language Groups and Dialects </h3>
        <p>Common</p>
        <h3>Common Etiquette Rules </h3>
        <p>Varies based on location.</p>
        <h3>Common Dress Code </h3>
        <p>Varies based on location.</p>
        <h3>Culture and Cultural Heritage </h3>
        <p>There are many traits humans have, but one binds them in common. The human spirit is a powerful driving force. It leads them to constantly better themselves, to attain new heights and make the world a better place for themselves. What the true definition of that is, is up to that human and thus a variable rainbow of conflict, that marks their kind.</p>
        <h3>History </h3>
        <p>The humans are a very strange sort who were originally created not in the traditional manner that most races are, but rather created by the dragons. The intent of this creation was twofold.

Although they possess short life spans, they are able to accomplish so much that many other races hide a thin jealously of how they spend their lives.</p>
        <h3>Historical Figures </h3>
        <p>Cassius Many More</p>
        <h3>Common Myths and Legends </h3>
        <p>Humans are capable of all manner of different forms of magic whether it be divine, arcane, primal, astral or any other variation of the different disciplines.This gave them the ability to stand out amongst the other races of the world. </p>
        <p>It is no surprise that humans are not strangers to war, they were bred to do so. Their experience in the subject, is rivaled by few and this experience and pure tenacity has led them to the current state of power and the grudging respect of the other races.</p>

        <h1 style="text-decoration: underline; font-size: 2.5em;">Humans Illithari</h1>
        <h2>Race Description</h2>
        <p>Illitharis look like normal humans, save for thier pale skin and ritualistic tattoos that they are born with. Thier most outlandish feature are the gemstones that grow in a crown around thier head as they use thier internal power more and more. The gemstone color matches with the element they end up manifesting.</p>
        <h2>Culture</h2>
        <h3>History </h3>
        <p>The Illithari are humans stolen from dragonkind early in their creation, their biomass was useful not only as a food source, but its malleability also made them potent psionic batteries for the Illithids in the underworld. It was the civil war of the grand minds below that allowed the first of these Illithari to escape their mental prisons and as such flee to the all corners of the underworld eventually founding a secret sanctum in the light of a great crystal. It is here they hid themselves away and locked away their psionic strength in the hopes that they will not be discovered. There were some illithids that saw the horror of what they had done, one in particular was found by one of the Illithari and was nursed back to health, even when the creature lost its memory the human gave him a name. Solomon Hancock. Eventually the memories of this being returned and with it the horror as to what he had done. It was then that Mr. H, raised up an army of humans and like-minded Illithids and fought for the freedom of all. He failed and the people he tried to save were returned to their mental prisons and Mr. H was banished to the surface, so that he might live with his failure. </p>
        <p>The Spirit of Freedom however, is not easily quelled. The witches took in this strange creature and in exchange for their care, he provided protection, until the day he could return to the underworld and free all those people from the great minds and take his place as a scion of his people and lead them out of their perpetual darkness. In the 6th era, not long ago, Mr. H got his chance, with a collection of Kalkatesh's bravest heroes, he ventured into the darkness below and with their aid, tore the mental shackles of his people asunder and forever was the underworld changed and branch of the human tree was returned to the surface and the glorious face of the sun.</p>

Should the character fail these death saving throws and die, they instead are raised as a husk. A horrible and dangerous monster that seeks to drain the souls of those around it. </p>

                <li>A Soprano song is a Nikira whose life has been guided by the most elegant of things. The greater arts, tastes and beauties that the world might offer.

                <li>An Alto song is a Nikira who is ruled by wanderlust, the need to experience new things and the enticing call of travel, their body a tapestry to the different places they have been and the interweaving of the notes such a song can sing. </li>
