        <h1 style="text-decoration: underline; font-size: 2.5em;">Elves</h1>
        <h2>Race Description</h2>
        <p>The long lived and aloof elves of Verum have a deep and morose history. Elves are often depicted with awe and jealousy, but most elves that live truly long lives wither away at just how much sorrow a single life can hold. </p>
        <p>There are many different types of elves depending on which world you are on and indeed Verum itself is home to many. The current subtypes available for play are the elves that exist on Kalkatesh. These are Wood Elves, High Elves and Dark Elves. Also living on Kalkatesh in some capacity are the immigrant Sharkai - the Ash Elves.</p>
        <h2>Racial Information</h2>
        <h3>Anatomy</h3>
        <p>Humanoid</p>
        <h3>Biological Traits </h3>
        <p>High elves is a reference to the original elven offshoot of the Eldar. These tan skinned elves, ruled much of the world, but they were mostly focused in Majital and Aontenese, which is now known as the Badlands. High Elves are mostly set apart from their kin due to the magic that is flowing through their veins, not unlike sorcerers, high elves possess the lineage of magic, not only due to their ancestry but also their constant exposure to magic. High Elves of old considered themselves to be superior to any other form of life, even their other elven counterparts. This, among other factors lead to the eventual downfall of their great empire. High Elves within the 6th era are shadows of their former selves. Some refuse to accept this fact and cling to old traditions and seek to have them reinstated, others look to the future and what their place in it might truly be. </p>
        <p>Wood elves are just like high elves in many ways, however, they acclimated differently to Kalkatesh, resulting in them retaining a fraction of their resonance to the Feywild. This gives them some control over nature, High Elves of old believed that Wood Elves were not true elves and many times the sub cultures came to blows, is was not until the fall of the elven empire that these elves went into hiding, some of these places were primal places resulting in transformations into Firbolgs. </p>
        <p>Dark elves are the youngest sub set of elven kind, formed at the end of the 2nd Era, formed not in the natural manner of adaptation, but rather created by a single act of betrayal. The imperial family, of Synonyne Twelvestar, ended when his son, Alian Twelvestar, murdered his father for the throne, in his dying breaths, the elven emporor, cursed his son, the effect, rendered his offspring impotent, ensuring the end of his family line and cursing his son and all his son’s co-conspirators with a blackened skin. Dark Elves, are often viewed with mistrust by other elves and pity from other races, as their banishment, caused them to roam Ii’tanas, until the Skarab Wars, in which it was drained of magic and then became the Badlands. Dark elves were the first of the elven races, to become nomads and as such can be found anywhere. </p>
        <p>Sharkai are Elves from a continent separate from Kalkatesh. They worship a god of death and battle, possess ashen skin - hence the nickname Ash Elves - and come from a land of famine and strife where every day is a struggle to survive. They are hardy, swift and intelligent - with bodies tempered by survival.</p>
        <h3>Genetics and Reproduction</h3>
        <p>Sexual Congress</p>
        <h3>Growth Rate and Stages </h3>
        <p>Physical Maturity at 15, Mental Maturity at 100</p>
        <h3>Ecology and Habitats</h3>
        <p>Most Elves in recent history were wanderers, living wherever their skills would find them welcome or simply being nomadic. More recently, the ancient Imperium has been reformed and it attempts to recreate a home for the Elves. The Badlands are a harsh, inhospitable place. The ancient ruins of the Imperium are slowly being rebuilt but progress ebbs and flows. </p>
        <p>The Sharkai on Kalkatesh originally descend from another continent of blood, dust and danger. Sharkai who have migrated live around the Mage's Guild in the sands of Majital.</p>
        <h3>Dietary Needs and Habits </h3>
        <p>Omnivorous</p>
        <h3>Facial characteristics </h3>
        <p>Pointy Ears</p>
        <h3>Average Intelligence </h3>
        <p>12</p>
        <h3>Perception and Sensory Capabilities </h3>
        <p>The Standard 5</p>
        <h2>Culture</h2>
        <h3>Naming Traditions </h3>
        <p>Elven names are varied as befitting their status as wanderers. Some Elves have been wanderers for so long they may have lost or forgotten their last names. With the re-founding of the Imperium, however, traditional Elven names may return. </p>
        <p>Sharkai have a three part naming system of family name, given name and rank.</p>
        <h3>Major Organizations </h3>
        <p>Ii’tanas Imperium</p>
        <h3>Beauty Ideals </h3>
        <p>Sharkai usually eschew fancy clothing in favor of practical gear.</p>
        <h3>Courtship Ideals </h3>
        <p>Sharkai Elves, when with a partner, perform a mating duel. Both sides are scantily clad in diaphanous clothing and armed with wooden weapons. The first one naked is the "loser".</p>
        <h3>Major Language Groups and Dialects </h3>
        <p>Elven</p>
        <h3>Culture and Cultural Heritage </h3>
        <p>Sharkai have a religious culture of brutal efficiency.</p>
        <h3>Common Taboos </h3>
        <p>Cowardice is considered a major shame among the Sharkai.</p>
        <h3>History </h3>
        <p>Elves are one of the first races to come into being, forming from the planting of the world seed (which in itself came from the Feywild). They, alongside other races, spread out among the wild new land, facing dangers and taming its creatures. The elves were challenged by the lizardfolk, the dwarves, and invaders from the astral sea, dragonkind. The dwarves retreated deep beneath the earth, content with their mountain strongholds. And they chose to rule the world beneath. The lizardfolk took to the harsher land with the more dangerous creatures, whom threatened them but served as a deterrent to interlopers. Dragonkind, new to this world stayed to the seas beyond in isles forged of dragonfire. This geographical advantage as well as their long life, gave elves the opportunity to multiply and spread into an empire that would claim much of Kalkatesh. The elven empire or Ii’tanas in the elven tongue, existed for the entirety of the second age, before it was brought low by betrayal and inner turmoil. It’s end marked the beginning of the third age where strange new races brought on by the elves rampant abuse of magic and other factors were born. The elves struggled to maintain a semblance of their glory, but each new age, left them more and more vulnerable. Now in the 6th age, they are little more than nomads wandering the ancient roads of Kalkatesh.</p>
        <h3>Interspecies Relations and Assumptions </h3>
        <p><b>Human: </b>Elves tend to view humans with a mixture of pity, awe and rivalry. As the humans were created as an army to face them, the elves have had to watch not only their great empire fail and fade, but the human empires rise in their place. </p>
        <p><b>Dwarf: </b>Elves tend to view dwarves as one of the few races that they might have a decent conversation with, alas if only they were better company in which to keep. Elves do not hate dwarves and indeed their ancient rivalries have mostly been forgotten. After all, the elves have already proven to be the superior race, it’s tough being at the top, if only the dwarves could… reach up here. They might have a swell time together. </p>
        <p><b>Gnome: </b>The relationship between the elves and the gnomes is one based nearly completely in confusion. As elves do not sleep, they do not dream, gnomes are beings that are inherently connected to dreams, so a conversation between a gnome and an elf, is usually a cavalcade of vacant stares, stuttering, poor topic segways and an all around uncomfortable experience. They do enjoy each other though, even if they don't understand each other. </p>
        <p><b>Halfling: </b>Elves and halflings have a fine relationship, the simplicity of halflings combos well with the traditions of elves and they often find themselves on common ground. </p>
        <p><b>Dragonborn: </b>Elves and Dragonborn have a deep seated mistrust of one another, as the latter are the newest and hopefully last attempt from the dragons to maintain their hold over the world. </p>
        <p><b>Plane Touched: </b>Elves and the plane touched have a pretty good relationship as they are not that different all things considered. </p>
        <p><b>Skinwalkers: </b>Elves and the skinwalkers are on shaky terms as skinwalkers were treated poorly under elven reign and some wounds take a long time to heal. Most elves and skinwalkers leave the past in the past, some however, do not. </p>
        <p><b>Greenskins: </b>Elves and the greenskins have been at war since the greenskins have existed, as such they are filled with an animosity that is difficult to surpress. </p>
        <p><b>Lizardfolk: </b>Elves and the Lizardfolk have had their problems in the past, but have done what they can to make amends, it has had, mixed success. Being some of the oldest races on Verum however, they have had much time to develop their relationship and oddly enough, their alliances with one another, are incredibly strong for creatures so different. </p>
        <p><b>Firbolg: </b>Elves and Firbolgs have a very positive relationship, due to the fact that Firbolgs are just mutated wood elves. They often times find themselves on the same side of most conflicts. </p>
        <p><b>Goliath: </b>Goliaths and Elves treat each other with a wide berth, giant blood cant be trusted.</p>

        <p><b>Speed: </b>30 feet</p>
        <p><b>Age: </b>Although elves reach physical maturity at about the same age as humans, the elven understanding of adulthood goes beyond physical growth to encompass worldly experience. An elf typically claims adulthood and an adult name around the age of 100 and can live to be 750 years old. </p>
        <p><b>Alignment: </b>Elves love freedom, variety, and self-expression, so they lean strongly toward the gentler aspects of chaos. They value and protect others' freedom as well as their own, and they are more often good than not. </p>
        <p><b>Size: </b>Elves range from under 5 to over 6 feet tall and have slender builds. Your size is Medium. </p>
        <p><b>Darkvision: </b>Accustomed to twilit forests and the night sky, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions.

        <p><b>Fey Ancestry: </b>You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put you to sleep. </p>
        <p><b>Trance:</b>Elves don't need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. (The Common word for such meditation is "trance.") While meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep. </p>
        <p><em>If you meditate during a long rest, you finish the rest after only 4 hours. You otherwise obey all the rules for a long rest; only the duration is changed.</em></p>
        <p><b>Elf Weapon Training:</b>You have proficiency with the longsword, shortsword, shortbow, and longbow. </p>
