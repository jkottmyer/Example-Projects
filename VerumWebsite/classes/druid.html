            <h1>Description</h1>
                <p>Holding high a gnarled staff wreathed with holly, an elf summons the fury of the storm and calls down explosive bolts of lightning to smite the torch-carrying orcs who threaten her forest.</p>
                <p>Crouching out of sight on a high tree branch in the form of a leopard, a human peers out of the jungle at the strange construction of a temple of Evil Elemental Air, keeping a close eye on the cultists' activities.</p>
                <p>Swinging a blade formed of pure fire, a half-elf charges into a mass of skeletal soldiers, sundering the unnatural magic that gives the foul creatures the mocking semblance of life.</p>
                <p>Whether calling on the elemental forces of nature or emulating the creatures of the animal world, druids are an embodiment of nature's resilience, cunning, and fury. They claim no mastery over nature. Instead, they see themselves as extensions of nature's indomitable will.</p>
            <h1>Power of Nature</h1>
                <p>Druids revere nature above all, gaining their spells and other magical powers either from the force of nature itself or from a nature deity. Many druids pursue a mystic spirituality of transcendent union with nature rather than devotion to a divine entity, while others serve gods of wild nature, animals, or elemental forces. The ancient druidic traditions are sometimes called the Old Faith, in contrast to the worship of gods in temples and shrines.</p>
                <p>Druid spells are oriented toward nature and animals—the power of tooth and claw, of sun and moon, of fire and storm. Druids also gain the ability to take on animal forms, and some druids make a particular study of this practice, even to the point where they prefer animal form to their natural form.</p>
            <h1>Preserve the Balance</h1>
                <p>For druids, nature exists in a precarious balance. The four elements that make up a world—air, earth, fire, and water—must remain in equilibrium. If one element were to gain power over the others, the world could be destroyed, drawn into one of the elemental planes and broken apart into its component elements. Thus, druids oppose cults of Elemental Evil and others who promote one element to the exclusion of others.</p>
                <p>Druids are also concerned with the delicate ecological balance that sustains plant and animal life, and the need for civilized folk to live in harmony with nature, not in opposition to it. Druids accept that which is cruel in nature, and they hate that which is unnatural, including aberrations (such as beholders and mind flayers) and undead (such as zombies and vampires). Druids sometimes lead raids against such creatures, especially when the monsters encroach on the druids' territory.</p>
                <p>Druids are often found guarding sacred sites or watching over regions of unspoiled nature. But when a significant danger arises, threatening nature's balance or the lands they protect, druids take on a more active role in combating the threat, as adventurers.</p>
                <h2 style="text-align: center;">Druids in Verum follow the same rules as Standard 5e. <a style="font-size: inherit;" href="https://5e.tools/classes.html#druid_phb" target="_blank">Official variants</a> are allowed as well as the variant(s) listed below.</h2>
            <h1><em>Circle of Spires</em></h1>
                <p><em>Druids of the Circle of Spires are dedicated to the advancement of the arcane knowledge of the elves, seeking efficient ways to take from the land without despoiling it. Many saw them as druids that were heretics, but only those with sharp minds and wisdom of what the future will bring could see what the druids of the spires could.</em></p>

                    <p>At 6th level, you learn two spells of your choice from any class. A spell you choose must be of a level you can cast, as shown on the Druid table, or a cantrip. The chosen spells count as druid spells for you.</p>
            <h2>Level 10<hr></h2>
            <p><em>At 10th level, you gain a feature granted by your Druid Circle feature based on your chosen spire.</em></p>

                <p>Once per turn whenever you deal damage with a weapon, you can add an extra 1d8 radiant damage.</p>
            <h2>Level 14<hr></h2>
            <p><em>At 14th level, you gain a feature granted by your Druid Circle feature based on your chosen spire.</em></p>
            <p><em>You can use your action to empower yourself with the might of your chosen spire for 1 minute. You can't use this feature again until you finish a long rest.</em></p>
                <h3>Spire of Knowledge</h3>
                <p><b>Emperor's Chosen</b></p>
                <p>You exude an aura of latent psychic energy. Any enemy that starts their turn within 15 feet of you takes 4d6 psychic damage.</p>

                <p>You exude an aura of golden light. You heal for 10 hit points at the start of each of your turns, even while unconscious. Your allies within 15 feet heal for 10 hit points at the start of each of their turns unless they are unconscious or otherwise defeated.</p>
                <h3>Spire of War</h3>
                <p><b>1,000 Years of War</b></p>
                <p>You become an avatar of druidic prowess. You can score critical hits with weapons on an 18-20, even while in your wild shape form. In addition, you deal extra damage once per turn to an enemy you hit equal to your character level.</p>
            <h1><em>Circle of Storms</em></h1>
            <p><em>The Circle of Storm is dedicated to the wrath of nature in her storms and the call of Kaheeli. Although the Matron of Discord is not an official member of the Green pantheon, they share mutual respect. And when the Green suffered, the wrath of the Goddess of the Sea was personified by the Circle of Storms.</em></p>
            <h2>Master of the Storm</h2>
            <p>At 2nd level, add the following cantrips and spells to your druid spell list, and you learn one cantrip from this list:</p>

                <li>Chain Lightning</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Kaheeli's Jealousy</h2>
            <p>At 2nd level, you deal 1 less damage with spells that do not deal thunder of lightning damage. You deal additional damage with spells that deal thunder or lightning damage equal to the spell's level. This is added once.</p>
            <h2>Level 6<hr></h2>
                <h3>Storm's Reach</h3>
                    <p>At 6th level, whenever you hard cast a spell that deals thunder or lightning damage, you can choose another enemy within 30 feet of you that was not the damaged by the spell. That enemy is struck by a minor bolt of lightning and thunder, dealing 1d6 lightning and 1d6 thunder damage to them.</p>
            <h2>Level 10<hr></h2>
            <p>Starting at 10th level, you gain the following benefits:</p>

                <li>If you hard cast the Call Lightning spell and you are in the open sea or on the coast (not shallow water, at the DM's discretion), the damage it deals is increased by 50%.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Level 14<hr></h2>
            <p>At 14th level, you gain immunity to lightning and thunder damage.</p>
