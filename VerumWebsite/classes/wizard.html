        <div id="classdescription">
            <h1>Description</h1>
                <p>Clad in the silver robes that denote her station, an elf closes her eyes to shut out the distractions of the battlefield and begins her quiet chant. Fingers weaving in front of her, she completes her spell and launches a tiny bead of fire toward the enemy ranks, where it erupts into a conflagration that engulfs the soldiers.</p>
                <p>Checking and rechecking his work, a human scribes an intricate magic circle in chalk on the bare stone floor, then sprinkles powdered iron along every line and graceful curve. When the circle is complete, he drones a long incantation. A hole opens in space inside the circle, bringing a whiff of brimstone from the otherworldly plane beyond.</p>   
                <p>Crouching on the floor in a dungeon intersection, a gnome tosses a handful of small bones inscribed with mystic symbols, muttering a few words of power over them. Closing his eyes to see the visions more clearly, he nods slowly, then opens his eyes and points down the passage to his left.</p>
                <p>Wizards are supreme magic-users, defined and united as a class by the spells they cast. Drawing on the subtle weave of magic that permeates the cosmos, wizards cast spells of explosive fire, arcing lightning, subtle deception, and brute-force mind control. Their magic conjures monsters from other planes of existence, glimpses the future, or turns slain foes into zombies. Their mightiest spells change one substance into another, call meteors down from the sky, or open portals to other worlds.</p>
            <h1>Scholars of the Arcane</h1>
                <p>Wild and enigmatic, varied in form and function, the power of magic draws students who seek to master its mysteries. Some aspire to become like the gods, shaping reality itself. Though the casting of a typical spell requires merely the utterance of a few strange words, fleeting gestures, and sometimes a pinch or clump of exotic materials, these surface components barely hint at the expertise attained after years of apprenticeship and countless hours of study.</p>
                <p>Wizards live and die by their spells. Everything else is secondary. They learn new spells as they experiment and grow in experience. They can also learn them from other wizards, from ancient tomes or inscriptions, and from ancient creatures (such as the fey) that are steeped in magic.</p>
            <h1>The Lure of Knowledge</h1>
                <p>Wizards' lives are seldom mundane. The closest a wizard is likely to come to an ordinary life is working as a sage or lecturer in a library or university, teaching others the secrets of the multiverse. Other wizards sell their services as diviners, serve in military forces, or pursue lives of crime or domination.</p>
                <p>But the lure of knowledge and power calls even the most unadventurous wizards out of the safety of their libraries and laboratories and into crumbling ruins and lost cities. Most wizards believe that their counterparts in ancient civilizations knew secrets of magic that have been lost to the ages, and discovering those secrets could unlock the path to a power greater than any magic available in the present age.</p>
                <h2 style="text-align: center;">Wizards in Verum follow the same rules as Standard 5e. <a style="font-size: inherit;" href="https://5e.tools/classes.html#wizard_phb" target="_blank">Official variants</a> are allowed as well as the variant(s) listed below.</h2>
            <h1><em>Cyphermage</em></h1>
                <p><em>Magic has many forms and you have focused yourself on the mastery of the glyph, the rune, and the ward. Instead of casting spells in the traditional manner, you convert them into one of these three forms for use in rapid succession.</em></p>
            <h2>Level 2<hr></h2>
                <h3>Spell Book Augmentation</h3>
                    <p>Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, you infuse your magic into your spellbook to quickly write your runes, glyphs, and wards. You must always have your spellbook in one of your hands. If you do not, you cannot cast spells nor can you benefit from set spells. However, while you are wielding your spellbook, it provides you a +2 bonus to AC that does not stack with a shield.</p>
                <h3>Inscribe</h3>
                    <p>You can no longer cast spells of 1st level or higher normally, instead, you can “set” these spells in one of three forms; Glyph, Ward, or Rune. The following are the rules for setting spells: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Glyph: A glyph is set on an object or surface. You must choose a surface that can support the application of magic in order to set a spell in this way. </li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Glyph Triggers: Pressure, Proximity or Timed</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>Ward: A Ward is set on a creature or object. You must choose a willing creature or object that can support the application of magic in order to set magic in this way. </li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Ward Triggers: Attacked, Proximity or Timed</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>Rune: A rune is set on a hostile creature or on a surface. It must be an applicable surface or the creature needs to fail its saving throw to be set in this way. </li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Rune Triggers: Timed, Action or Activation</li>
                        </ul>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Glyphs, wards, and runes are visual representations of written magic wherever they're placed. They're always visible, unless visually blocked by heavy obscuration or cover. A set glyph or rune on a surface always takes up the space of a 5-foot square on that surface, while a set glyph, ward, or rune on an object or creature conforms to the size of that object or creature. A visible glyph, ward, or rune can be identified with an Intelligence (Arcana) check at DC 12 + the spell's level. </p>
                    <p>There can be no more than 3 glyphs, wards, or runes set on an object or creature in a single 5-foot square, regardless of the object or creature's individual sizes. There can only be 1 set glyph or rune on a 5-foot surface. </p>
                    <p>Set spells last until triggered, or until you prepare spells or otherwise finish a long rest, whichever happens first. Set spells that disappear due to you preparing spells or finishing a long rest do so harmlessly. </p>
                    <p>The following are the rules for triggers and their general application: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Pressure: This triggers if it is stepped on or attacked directly. The DM may also rule other extreme forces from a falling object or pushed creature can also trigger the set magic.</li>
                        <li>Proximity: This triggers based on any creature entering proximity. You determine the proximity in increments of feet, up to the spell's range. If the spell has a range of self, the proximity range can be up to 5 feet. You can choose to have the set spell ignore you when you initially set it, and during your turn at a later time to then count you for its proximity.</li>
                        <li>Timed: This triggers based on a set timer, determined by you. The timing must be set in increments of rounds, minutes, or hours. In combat, the increments are based off your turn in the initiative. You cannot set a spell to go off at a precise time, such as noon.</li>
                        <li>Attacked: This triggers based on whether or not an enemy takes a hostile action against the warded creature. This trigger has additional definitions that must be clarified: it can trigger from an attack roll or a saving throw, but not both. The selection is made when you set the spell.</li>
                        <li>Action: This triggers based on whether an enemy does or does not take a predetermined maneuver. The maneuvers that can be chosen in this manner are attack, cast spell, move, or item interaction.</li>
                        <li>Activation: This triggers based on whether another glyph, rune, or ward is triggered. The corresponding set spells must be within 30 feet of each other in order for this trigger to function.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>When you set a spell, you or your familiar must be able to touch the surface, object or creature. Setting a spell takes the same casting time as normally casting it would. For spells that require a reaction to an event, you instead use your reaction during your turn to set it. A spell set in this manner uses the applied placement as its point of origin for the spell, and is triggered as long as you can see both the set spell and the trigger. You choose targets, direct area-of-effects, or other such interactions as normal once a set spell is triggered. If the spell has a range of touch, or requires an attack to be made, the range is determined from the set spell's placement, not you. For example, a glyph of Mage Armor, when triggered by proximity, can only be used to affect a creature that is within touch range of the glyph, provided you are able to see the target when it's triggered. </p>
                    <p>When a rune is set on an unwilling creature, they must make a saving throw if the spell would normally have one. If the spell would not normally have one for a creature, then they must make an Intelligence saving throw against your spell save DC. If the creature fails this save, the rune is placed on them and, should it be triggered, they suffer the spell's effects. They do not receive an additional saving throw when the spell is triggered. </p>
                    <p>When you set a spell that requires concentration, you do not concentrate on it until it is triggered. </p>
                    <p>Set spells are considered hard cast and interact with effects that require casting a spell when a set spell is triggered, not when they're set. </p>
            <h2>Level 6<hr></h2>
                <h3>Rising Tempo</h3>
                    <p>At 6th level, whenever you cast a damaging cantrip, its damage is increased by 1 for each glyph, ward or rune within 15 feet of you, to a maximum of 5. The damage increase applies to each application of damage from the cantrip. </p>
            <h2>Level 10<hr></h2>
                <h3>Cypherwalking</h3>
                    <p>At 10th level, you can use a bonus action to teleport to any rune, glyph, or ward you can see. If it is on a surface, you teleport to the 5-foot square, or if it is on a creature or object, you teleport within 5 feet of it. </p>
            <h2>Level 14<hr></h2>
                <h3>Cyphertechnics</h3>
                    <p>At 14th level, you can use a bonus action to choose up to three runes, wards, or glyphs that you can see within 30 feet. You cause them to explode, dealing 1d8 force damage per spell level of the set spell within 15 feet of each of their placements to enemies. This effect can be used to trigger any other glyph, rune or ward of your choice, but they must be within 30 feet of each other.</p>
            <h1><em>Void Mage</em></h1>
                <p><em>There is a structure of magic that lies on the other side, a sort of aetheric nothingness, that moves into shape and form. Although it is difficult to manipulate, some mages focus on this intriguing and mysterious force.</em></p>
            <h2>Void Mage Spells</h2>
            <p>Void Mages gain access to a unique spell list:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>2nd level - Focus of the Void, Mark of the Everpresent, Javelin of the Empty, Strength of Being, Pulsar, Void Ensnarement</li>
                <li>3rd level - Point of Entropy, Ephemeral Position, Void Mage Armor</li>
                <li>4th level - Void’s Reach, Incantation of Emptiness, Essence Rip, Reposition, Spell Grasp</li>
                <li>5th level - Force of Will, Mana Shearing, Magic Obliteration</li>
                <li>6th level - Wail of the Ephemeral</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Level 2<hr></h2>
                <h3>Spell Book Augmentation</h3>
                    <p>Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the gold and time you must spend to copy a spell that deals force damage into your spell book is halved. </p>
                <h3>Forceful Magic</h3>
                    <p>Starting at 2nd level when you choose this school, you gain Eldritch Blast as a cantrip, and it counts as a wizard cantrip for you. Whenever you cast a spell that deals force damage, that spell deals an additional point of damage for each target equal to the level of the spell. </p>
            <h2>Level 6<hr></h2>
                <h3>Grasp of the Void</h3>
                    <p>At 6th level, you can use a bonus action to choose an enemy you can see within 30 feet and pull on its existence from the void. This causes them to have disadvantage on all attack rolls, saving throws and ability checks for 1d4 rounds. While the enemy is affected by this feature, you also have disadvantage on such rolls. If the enemy is defeated while under this effect, you gain advantage to these rolls equal to the number of rounds you suffered the disadvantage in this way (minimum of 1 round). </p>
                    <p>Once you use this feature, you cannot do so again until you finish a short or long rest. </p>
            <h2>Level 10<hr></h2>
                <h3>Darkwalker</h3>
                    <p>At 10th level, you gain resistance to cold and necrotic damage. </p>
                    <p>In addition, the first time you would be reduced to 0 hit points, you are reduced to 1 hit point instead. You can't use this feature again until you finish a long rest. </p>
            <h2>Level 14<hr></h2>
                <h3>Forzare’</h3>
                    <p>At 14th level, if you defeat an enemy with a spell that deals force damage, that enemy screams as void energy flows out from it. A Magic Missile spell of the highest level you can cast is cast from the enemy's space, striking out at random enemy targets within range. This feature can trigger itself, but only a maximum number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier in one instance.</p>
            <h1><em>Cruormancer</em></h1>
                <p><em>"Magic in the blood," a concept sorcerers only believe they understand. But true might comes from the blood itself - you understand this and have learned the secrets of the sanguine.</em></p>
            <h2>Level 2<hr></h2>
                <h3>Spell Book Augmentation</h3>
                    <p>Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the gold and time you must spend to copy a necromancy spell into your spellbook is halved. </p>
                <h3>Bloodprice</h3>
                    <p>Starting at 2nd level, whenever you cast a spell that would cause an enemy to make a saving throw, you can consume your own hit points to increase the spell's potency. You spend a number of hit points equal to your character level to increase the saving throw DC of the spell by 1. You can do this up to three times per spell. </p>
                    <p>After you use this feature, you cannot regain hit points for a number of rounds equal to the spell's level, as your body is in shock. </p>
            <h2>Level 6<hr></h2>
                <h3>Backlash</h3>
                    <p>At 6th level, whenever you receive damage from a critical hit, you can use your reaction to hard cast a spell of your choice that has a casting time of an action or bonus action. </p>
                    <p>Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest. </p>
            <h2>Level 10<hr></h2>
                <h3>The Master Calls</h3>
                    <p>At 10th level, whenever an enemy takes damage from a spell you hard cast, they also receive an amount of bleeding damage equal to the spell's level. This only applies once per source. </p>
            <h2>Level 14<hr></h2>
                <h3>Fear the Old Blood</h3>
                    <p>At 14th level, you can use your Bloodprice feature any number of times per spell.</p>
