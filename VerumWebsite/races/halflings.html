        <h2>Race Description</h2>

They themselves have been in the backdrop of most of history, content to have a nice meal and relax in their homes. There have been, in moments of strife, where halflings were the uinexpected heroes, showing the world that they were as strong as any race and more importantly, fearless when the time came. Within them stirs the spirit of home and in equal measure, the conviction to defend.</p>

        <h3>Ecology and Habitats </h3>

        <p>Halfling</p>
        <h3>History </h3>
        <p>Halflings just appeared one day, some believe they are the spawn of gnomes and humans, others believed they are a magical experiment. But the truth, is that in a time of great peril, humanity was threatened in the first planar war, hunted by the Slaad and pushed nearly to extinction. It was then, in a final stand at the Gate of Gil, that human blood spilled into the meadow of Hasta. What the humans believed to be just a simple, beautiful meadow was in fact, the remnants of one of the Eldar stars. Thus a small being was formed in a rapid succession, a being whom could fight against the Slaad fear that stole the humans courage. They rose up naked and screaming to fight against these beings and the day was won. Mistake for children, the halflings were taken in by humankind and such the new race was born.</p>
