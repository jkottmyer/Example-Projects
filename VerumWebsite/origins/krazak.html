        <h1 style="text-decoration: underline; font-size: 2.5em;">Krazax</h1>
        <p><em>The kingdom of Krazax has stood since the Second Era, outlasting even the elven imperial empire. The dwarves have carved a sturdy home out of the rock and stone of the Spine of Crovux where they have opened thier borders to other races that wish to live in law and peace.</em></p>
        <h2>Structure</h2>
        <p>Hereditary Monarchy</p>
        <h2>Public Agenda </h2>
        <p>To build a civilization, that will stand the test of time.</p>
        <h2>Assets</h2>
        <p>Silver, Gold, Gems, Masters of Craft and Military expertise.</p>
        <h2>Origin Bonus</h2>
        <p>Krazax is the mountain home of the Dwarves. Whose massive halls stretch deep underground and needled throughout the land. Although it is the home of the Dwarves, races of all kinds thrive and abide there. All of them influenced by the no nonsense attitude and unshakable loyalty of the Dwarves. Krazaxians are gifted the following abilities and may choose from various subtypes. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The hardiness of the Dwarves is heavily influenced in all Krazaxians. You gain +1 Constitution.</li>
            <li>The mountains are harsh country and only those with the skills survive. Skill Prof – Survival</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Sub-Origins:</h2>
        <p>Backgrounds in Verum are replaced with an origin and sub-origin. Players select a sub-origin listed below and recived bonuses from both the origin and sub-origin.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="left">
        <h1>Forgechild</h1>
        <p>The forges of Krazax are responsible for some of the most magnificent creations ever seen in all of Verum. From weapons and armor to buildings and bridges to even the smallest nail. Each creation from Krazax is done by masterful hands of great forge families. Whose clan’s heritage goes back almost as far as the mountains. </p>
        <p>You were born under this pedigree, a craftsman by birth and with the forge in your veins, even if you never showed interest, the skills are there waiting to be used. You were raised around the forge fire. You know its rings and falls all too well. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>You can spend an additional 20 gold pieces per crafting day spent on progressing magic and mundane item crafting. This effectively increases your crafting speed for those items. </li>
            <li>You gain proficiency in the Religion skill, and with Smith's Tools.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="left">
        <h1>Greenskin-Bane</h1>
        <p>Krazax is the home to the dwarves, but also to their ancient enemies of goblin-kind. Goblin kind mostly consists of Goblins, Orcs, Hob-Goblins and Bugbears. There are many types of these creatures and there are those whose hatred of these creatures is so intense, they dedicate themselves to their eradication. </p>
        <p>Some might call you a zealot, some haven’t seen what goblins are truly capable of. Sure, some might be redeemable and you would never harm someone who is an official citizen. But some, are just plain evil. You are ready to end them. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your hatred of goblin-kind runs deep. You gain a +3 to attack rolls vs creatures of the greenskin subtype. </li>
            <li>Skill Prof – Nature</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="left">
        <h1>Legionnaire</h1>
        <p>The Legionnaires of Krazax has long protected her borders and from the wild denizens within. These brave and disciplined warriors are among the best infantry in Verum, earning them even a grudging respect from Daborak. These warriors are used to fighting things they are often outmatched against, and using the mountains to mask tier approach. Therefore they tend to use their wits to overcome an enemy. Regardless of their final calling, once a legionnaire always a legionnaire. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>You were issued the tools you need to do your job. You receive proficiency with a single martial weapon. If you already possess all martial weapon proficiencies, you may instead choose one weapon or unarmed strikes and gain a +1 to attack rolls with them. </li>
            <li>Skill Prof – Martial</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="left">
        <h1>Lowlander</h1>
        <p>Not every Krazaxian lives within the mountains, some choose to live in the bountiful fields of the lowlands. The lowlands provide the main supply of food for all of Krazax, therefore lowlanders are known to be well fed and strong. </p>
        <p>You have lived your entire life in the shadow of the mountains. Always looking up at them, like stone sentinels watching over you, you have toiled the land and found a sense of peace in it. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Dwarven influence, plus a well fed upbringing has made you inappropriately hardy. You gain +5 to your maximum hitpoints. </li>
            <li>Skill Prof – Athletics</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="left">
        <h1>Minesworn</h1>
        <p>The great mines of Krazax hold many hidden troves and wondrous treasures. Such places are highly guarded, only the best of the best of miners are allowed within these hallowed mines. The ones that get in, however, are forever changed by them. </p>
        <p>Your journey within the mines began as a humble apprentice and now you are in the big leagues. Mining in these hallowed halls has shown you that so much lies in the stone, more than most can imagine. Your experience there has forever changed you. </p>
        <p>Exposure to the hallowed mines has infused you with the ability to sense wealth.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You gain a +3 bonus to your passive perception and passive investigation. This bonus does not stack with the Observant feat. </li>
            <li>You gain proficiency in the Perception skill, and with Jeweler's Tools.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="left">
        <h1>Peakfolk</h1>
        <p>Peakfolk are a curious lot, living high above their Krazaxian brothers in barely hospitable and incredibly dangerous areas of the mountains, they still manage to stake out a living. The Peakfolk are more isolated than perhaps any other kind of Krazaxian, as they rarely come down from their lofty peaks. Their monasteries are some of the most enlightened in the world, many philosophers and monks make pilgrimages to these lofty heights. In the hope their understanding might be expanded. </p>
        <p>You have looked down from your high perch since you were young. No sense of fear but instead of wonder. The entire world opens out in front of you, your eyes straining far to the tips of the land, the clouds floating just out of reach. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>To fall would be… undesirable. You gain advantage on any skill checks and saving throws to avoid falling off an edge of a height greater than 10ft. </li>
            <li>Skill Prof – Acrobatics</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="left">
        <h1>Rangeroamer</h1>
        <p>Some love to live on the great mountain passes within Krazax. These people often own inns and taverns along the many paths. Providing travelers with a place to rest, or even traveling themselves, from place to place selling wares. </p>
        <p>You have traveled the mountain passes most of your life. You have learned of the many shortcuts and faced the many dangers that lie there. You have also met many travelers and the feeling of providing respite to others has influenced your abilities. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your ability to care for others further aids you in assisting your allies. Whenever you use the help action, your ally receives an additional +2 to their total roll. </li>
            <li>Skill Prof – History</li>
        </ul>
