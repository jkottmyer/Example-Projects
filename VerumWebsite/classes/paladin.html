            <h1>Description</h1>
                <p>Clad in plate armor that gleams in the sunlight despite the dust and grime of long travel, a human lays down her sword and shield and places her hands on a mortally wounded man. Divine radiance shines from her hands, the man's wounds knit closed, and his eyes open wide with amazement.</p>
                <p>A dwarf crouches behind an outcrop, his black cloak making him nearly invisible in the night, and watches an orc war band celebrating its recent victory. Silently, he stalks into their midst and whispers an oath, and two orcs are dead before they even realize he is there.</p>
                <p>Silver hair shining in a shaft of light that seems to illuminate only him, an elf laughs with exultation. His spear flashes like his eyes as he jabs again and again at a twisted giant, until at last his light overcomes its hideous darkness.</p>
                <p>Whatever their origin and their mission, paladins are united by their oaths to stand against the forces of evil. Whether sworn before a god's altar and the witness of a priest, in a sacred glade before nature spirits and fey beings, or in a moment of desperation and grief with the dead as the only witness, a paladin's oath is a powerful bond. It is a source of power that turns a devout warrior into a blessed champion.</p>
            <h1>The Cause of Righteousness</h1>
                <p>A paladin swears to uphold justice and righteousness, to stand with the good things of the world against the encroaching darkness, and to hunt the forces of evil wherever they lurk. Different paladins focus on various aspects of the cause of righteousness, but all are bound by the oaths that grant them power to do their sacred work. Although many paladins are devoted to gods of good, a paladin's power comes as much from a commitment to justice itself as it does from a god.</p>
                <p>Paladins train for years to learn the skills of combat, mastering a variety of weapons and armor. Even so, their martial skills are secondary to the magical power they wield: power to heal the sick and injured, to smite the wicked and the undead, and to protect the innocent and those who join them in the fight for justice.</p>
            <h1>Beyond the Mundane Life</h1>
                <p>Almost by definition, the life of a paladin is an adventuring life. Unless a lasting injury has taken him or her away from adventuring for a time, every paladin lives on the front lines of the cosmic struggle against evil. Fighters are rare enough among the ranks of the militias and armies of the world, but even fewer people can claim the true calling of a paladin. When they do receive the call, these warriors turn from their former occupations and take up arms to fight evil. Sometimes their oaths lead them into the service of the crown as leaders of elite groups of knights, but even then their loyalty is first to the cause of righteousness, not to crown and country.</p>
                <p>Adventuring paladins take their work seriously. A delve into an ancient ruin or dusty crypt can be a quest driven by a higher purpose than the acquisition of treasure. Evil lurks in dungeons and primeval forests, and even the smallest victory against it can tilt the cosmic balance away from oblivion.</p>
                <h2 style="text-align: center;">Paladins in Verum follow the same rules as Standard 5e. <a style="font-size: inherit;" href="https://5e.tools/classes.html#paladin_phb" target="_blank">Official variants</a> are allowed as well as the variant(s) listed below.</h2>
            <h1><em>Oath of the Linnorms</em></h1>
                <p><em>Those that swear fealty to the Linnorms will find themselves infused with the power of the Primal Dragons, a power worthier than any deity. Those that follow this Oath care for the power of the self and the unprejudiced authority of facts.</em></p>
            <h3>Tenets of the Linnorms</h3>
            <p>Those that follow the path of the Linnorms hold these four simple truths above all else. </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The strong impose their will, the weak do not. Good, evil, chaos, law - these things are only possible through might.</li>
                <li>Lies are the tools of the weak. Embrace what you are and feel not ashamed.</li>
                <li>It is naive to believe peace will last. Strive to control your world.</li>
                <li>Serve the Linnorms, and punish the usurper dragons - those that would steal the world for themselves.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Oath Spells</h3>
            <p>You gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>3rd - Cause Fear, Jump</li>
                <li>5th - Enhance Ability, Dragon's Breath</li>
                <li>9th - Bestow Curse, Fear</li>
                <li>13th - Freedom of Movement, Otiluke's Resilient Sphere</li>
                <li>17th - Skill Empowerment, Legend Lore </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Channel Divinity: Cull the Meek</h3>
            <p>Whenever you defeat an enemy with a melee weapon attack, you can use your Channel Divinity as a reaction. If you do, make a melee weapon attack another enemy creature within your reach. If you defeat this creature, you can repeat this process until you do not defeat a creature you've attacked. Each enemy creature you defeat while using this ability gives you a stacking +1 bonus to weapon damage rolls. You can move as normal between these attacks if you have movement to spend. </p>
            <h3>Channel Divinity: Predator, or Prey?</h3>
            <p>As a bonus action, you bolster the resolve of your allies, granting advantage to the next saving throw they make within 1 minute. This effect ends early for an ally if they willingly move away from an enemy. </p>
            <h2>Level 7<hr></h2>
                <h3>Primal Smites</h3>
                    <p>At 7th level, your Divine Smites deal primal damage instead of radiant damage.</p>
            <h2>Level 15<hr></h2>
                <h3>Lay Waste</h3>
                    <p>At 15th level, whenever you use Divine Smite, all of the target's allies that are within 5 feet of it take primal damage equal to the damage dealt by the Divine Smite. </p>
            <h2>Level 20<hr></h2>
                <h3>Linnorm Champion</h3>
                    <p>At 20th level you take on a primal form, champion of the Linnorms. You gain the following benefits: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Your walking speed increases by 20 feet</li>
                        <li>You have darkvision with a range of 120 feet</li>
                        <li>You gain advantage on attack rolls using Strength</li>
                        <li>Whenever you hit a creature with a melee weapon, the creature takes an extra 2d6 primal damage</li>
                    </ul>
            <h1><em>Oath of the Time Warden</em></h1>
                <p><em>There are those that serve Raquel directly in her impossible task of fixing time. They serve as wardens against its manipulations and indeed seek to correct jaunts and portals into the past and visions of the future. Prophecy and sight may reveal hints to a future impossible to realize. Only by the actions of these protectors can such impossible branches be avoided and doom diverted.</em></p>
            <h3>Tenets of the Time Warden</h3>
            <p>The Tenets of the Time Warden is held to keep the manipulations of time intact and to safeguard the errant use of such magic. </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The Present is the Only Gift: Do not benefit or allow others to use revelations about the future to augment their actions. </li>
                <li>Protect the Undetermined: A fate unknown is a blessed thing, the purest form of freedom. Keep safe this holy ignorance whenever you can. </li>
                <li>Protect the Sanctity of the Past: What has happened is paramount and changing it is blasphemous. Disallow any changing of the past, unless it is by the blessed hands of Raquel or her servants. </li>
                <li>Joy for All: Always the new, unknown and exciting. Raquel’s gnomish nature is reflected in this tenet, that you should always offer a smile or a joke, for laughter is your greatest weapon.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Oath Spells</h3>
            <p>You gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>3rd - Shield, Sanctuary</li>
                <li>5th - Zone of Truth, Find Traps</li>
                <li>9th - Haste, Dispel Magic</li>
                <li>13th - Banishment, Death Ward</li>
                <li>17th - Greater Restoration, Far Step</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Channel Divinity: Time Rift</h3>
            <p>All allies within 30 feet have their current hit points reset to what they were at the beginning of your last turn. This can cause those that died to live again, and those that were brought back to life to die once more. </p>
            <h3>Channel Divinity: Time Splinter</h3>
            <p>You disappear from existence until the start of your next turn. Doing so causes your hit points to be restored as though you are benefiting from a short rest, allowing you to spend hit dice as normal. You reappear at an available square of your choice within 30 feet. </p>
            <h2>Level 7<hr></h2>
                <h3>Quicksilver Aura</h3>
                    <p>At 7th level, the windings of time quicken around you, granting you and your allies that start their turn within 10 feet of you a 10-foot bonus to speed. </p>
                    <p>At 18th level, the range and bonus to speed from this aura both increase to 30 feet. </p>
            <h2>Level 15<hr></h2>
                <h3>Clockstop</h3>
                    <p>At 15th level, your power over time and service to Raquel grants you access to directly manipulate it, allowing you to cast the spell Time Stop. </p>
                    <p>Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until a week has passed. </p>
            <h2>Level 20<hr></h2>
                <h3>Timewalker</h3>
                    <p>At 20th level, you become one of the direct servants of Raquel and walk with a fraction of her power. As an action, you can magically undergo a transformation, gaining the following benefits for 1 minute: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>You gain an additional action on your turn. This functions like the Haste spell, and it can be in effect at the same time as Haste</li>
                        <li>Attacks against you have disadvantage, as your form is semi-permanent</li>
                        <li>As a bonus action you can teleport an ally you can see to any point you can see within 120 feet. This also heals the ally for 10d6 hit points</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>
