        <h1 style="text-decoration: underline; font-size: 2.5em;">Plane-Touched</h1>
        <h2>Race Description</h2>
        <p>The plane touched have been a pretty common occurrence within Verum. The inner planes have mixed with the prime for as long as they have all existed. This has lead to some interesting and bizarre occurrences as far as races go. Many different types of such creatures exist, they are as varied as the planes themselves whether they be the genasi, tiefling, aasimar, triton or something else entirely. Such creatures do not have much of a history, as they themselves are connected to two worlds. As such, most feel as if they do not belong, many are burdened by this feeling, others use it to fuel their ambitions to even greater heights.</p>
        <h2>Racial Information</h2>
        <h3>Anatomy </h3>
        <p>A genasi is a mortal born with a confluence of elemental power within their blood. These creatures can result from a union of mortal and elemental flesh, such occurrences are far rarer do to the often times incompatible anatomy with elemental beings. More often than not these occurrences appear due to proximity to a place of power, normally of nature or sometimes a rift between the planes torn by rampant magic. </p>
        <p>Aasimars are beings born with a hint of celestial blood within them. This blood can be gained through the parring of celestial and mortal flesh, born during a holy day in the right place or simply being blessed by a particularly potent priest during pregnancy. As much as the celestials would like you to believe that most births are that of immaculate purposes and holy writ. The truth is that a celestial finds love in mortal flesh and aasimars are made the common way children are made far more common. Such beings are often held responsible for good fortunes brought about and as such much of the time, a lot is expected from them, some buckle under this pressure, others persevere and thrive under the attention. </p>
        <p>The beings that have the hardest time of all fitting in are those born with a hint of fiendish blood. Beings born this way are often that of traditional creation, born in times of great misery, consumption of dangerous substances during birth and of course curses. Whatever their reason for existing, tieflings often times are born for misfortunes, as it is easier to blame the creature with horns for your problems than deal with them yourself. Some are driven into despair and hopelessness by the unfairness they are shown, others, flourish in spite of it.</p>
        <h3>Biological Traits </h3>
        <p>Bipedal humanoids, potentially with various strange augmentations even extending to extra limps or bony outcroppings.</p>
        <h3>Genetics and Reproduction </h3>
        <p>Planar-touched are born of both planar and non-planar parents.</p>
        <h3>Ecology and Habitats </h3>
        <p>Anywhere in the world in which mortals can be found, the plane touched can be found amongst them. They are found in greater number around places of power or where the practice of communication with the inner planes is common.</p>
        <h3>Dietary Needs and Habits </h3>
        <p>Omnivorous</p>
        <h3>Perception and Sensory Capabilities </h3>
        <p>Basic five with some enhanced senses relating to vision, magical detection and perhaps even sensing tremors in the ground.</p>
        <h2>Culture</h2>
        <h3>Major Language Groups and Dialects </h3>
        <p>Aquan Auran Ignan Terran Celestial Wicked</p>

        <p><b>Healing Hands: </b>As an action, you can touch a creature and cause it to regain a number of hit points equal to your level. Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>
        <p><b>Light Bearer: </b>You know the light cantrip. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for it. </p>
        <p><b>Radiant Consumption: </b>Starting at 3rd level, you can use your action to unleash the divine energy within yourself, causing a searing light to radiate from you, pour out of your eyes and mouth, and threaten to char you.</p>
        <p>Your transformation lasts for 1 minute or until you end it as a bonus action. During it, you shed bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet, and at the end of each of your turns, you and each creature within 10 feet of you take radiant damage equal to half your level (rounded up). In addition, once on each of your turns, you can deal extra radiant damage to one target when you deal damage to it with an attack or a spell. The extra radiant damage equals your level. Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>
        <p><b>Languages: </b>You can speak, read, and write Common and Celestial.</p>
