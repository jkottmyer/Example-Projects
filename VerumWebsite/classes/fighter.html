        <div id="classdescription">
            <h1>Description</h1>
                <p>A human in clanging plate armor holds her shield before her as she runs toward the massed goblins. An elf behind her, clad in studded leather armor, peppers the goblins with arrows loosed from his exquisite bow. The half-orc nearby shouts orders, helping the two combatants coordinate their assault to the best advantage.</p>
                <p>A dwarf in chain mail interposes his shield between the ogre's club and his companion, knocking the deadly blow aside. His companion, a half-elf in scale armor, swings two scimitars in a blinding whirl as she circles the ogre, looking for a blind spot in its defenses.</p>
                <p>A gladiator fights for sport in an arena, a master with his trident and net, skilled at toppling foes and moving them around for the crowd's delight—and his own tactical advantage. His opponent's sword flares with blue light an instant before she sends lightning flashing forth to smite him.</p>
                <p>All of these heroes are fighters, perhaps the most diverse class of characters in the worlds of Dungeons & Dragons. Questing knights, conquering overlords, royal champions, elite foot soldiers, hardened mercenaries, and bandit kings—as fighters, they all share an unparalleled mastery with weapons and armor, and a thorough knowledge of the skills of combat. And they are well acquainted with death, both meting it out and staring it defiantly in the face.</p>
            <h1>Well-Rounded Specialists</h1>
                <p>Fighters learn the basics of all combat styles. Every fighter can swing an axe, fence with a rapier, wield a longsword or a greatsword, use a bow, and even trap foes in a net with some degree of skill. Likewise, a fighter is adept with shields and every form of armor. Beyond that basic degree of familiarity, each fighter specializes in a certain style of combat. Some concentrate on archery, some on fighting with two weapons at once, and some on augmenting their martial skills with magic. This combination of broad general ability and extensive specialization makes fighters superior combatants on battlefields and in dungeons alike.</p>
            <h1>Trained for Danger</h1>
                <p>Not every member of the city watch, the village militia, or the queen's army is a fighter. Most of these troops are relatively untrained soldiers with only the most basic combat knowledge. Veteran soldiers, military officers, trained bodyguards, dedicated knights, and similar figures are fighters.</p>
                <p>Some fighters feel drawn to use their training as adventurers. The dungeon delving, monster slaying, and other dangerous work common among adventurers is second nature for a fighter, not all that different from the life he or she left behind. There are greater risks, perhaps, but also much greater rewards—few fighters in the city watch have the opportunity to discover a magic flame tongue sword, for example.</p>
                <h2 style="text-align: center;">Fighters in Verum follow the same rules as Standard 5e. <a style="font-size: inherit;" href="https://5e.tools/classes.html#fighter_phb" target="_blank">Official variants</a> are allowed as well as the variant(s) listed below.</h2>
            <p style="text-align: center;padding-top:10px;"><a href="#battle">Battle Herald</a> <a href="#dancing">Dancing Blade</a> <a href="#rytherian">Rytherian Fighter</a> <a href="#moon">Aden’ka’ael (Moon Warrior)</a> <a href="#unbreakable">Unbreakable</a> <a href="#sanguine">Sanguine Knight</a></p>
            <h1 id="battle"><em>Battle Herald</em></h1>
                <p><em>Battle Heralds are warriors that have dedicated themselves to the pursuit of organized warfare, from inspiring commands, to cunning tactics and of course, their own individual prowess makes a Battle Herald a formidable ally and a deadly opponent.</em></p>
            <h2>Level 3<hr></h2>
                <h3>Rallying Cry</h3>
                    <p>At 3rd level, you learn how to inspire your allies to fight on past their injuries. </p>
                    <p>When you use your Second Wind class feature, all allies that can see or hear you within 60 feet heal an equal amount of hit points that you healed. </p>
                <h3>Expanded Tactics</h3>
                    <p>When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you learn other methods to deal with conflict. </p>
                    <p>You gain proficiency with the Persuasion and Performance skills. </p>
            <h2>Level 7<hr></h2>
                <h3>Inspiring Surge</h3>
                    <p>Starting at 10th level, when you use your Action Surge class feature, you can choose a number of allies equal to your Intelligence modifier within 60 feet of you. They can make one melee or ranged weapon attack with their reaction, provided that they can see or hear you. </p>
                    <p>Starting at 18th level, the chosen allies gain advantage on the attacks they make by the use of this ability.</p>
            <h2>Level 15<hr></h2>
                <h3>Bulwark</h3>
                    <p>Beginning at 15th level, you can extend the benefit of your Indomitable feature to an ally. When you use Indomitable to reroll an Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma saving throw and you aren't incapacitated, you can choose one ally within 60 feet of you that also failed its saving throw against the same effect. If the ally can see or hear you, it can reroll its saving throw and must use the new roll. </p>
            <h2>Level 18<hr></h2>
                <h3>To Arms!</h3>
                    <p>At 18th level, you can use a bonus action to give all allies and yourself a +2 bonus to attack rolls, damage rolls, AC, and saving throws for 1 minute.</p>
            <h1 id="dancing"><em>Dancing Blade</em></h1>
                <p><em>At 3rd level, you are able to more acutely strike with lighter weapons to cause more damage. Light or twinned melee weapons that deal slashing or piercing damage are considered Flashing Blade weapons. Attacks with a Flashing Blade weapon deal 1 additional damage of the weapon’s type. </em></p>
            <h2>Level 3<hr></h2>
                <h3>Improved Dual Weapon Fighting</h3>
                    <p>At 3rd level, the fighting style that you gained at first level is changed to Two-Weapon Fighting.</p>
                    <p>Additionally, once per turn, you deal an extra 1d10 slashing damage to one creature you hit with an attack, if that creature was also hit with a weapon wielded in your other hand on that same turn. Both attacks must use a Flashing Blade weapon. </p>
            <h2>Level 7<hr></h2>
                <h3>Flying Blades</h3>
                    <p>Starting at 7th level, you can draw Flashing Blade weapons as part of the attack to use them, and being within 5 feet of a hostile creature doesn’t impose disadvantage on your ranged attack rolls with Flashing Blade weapons that have the thrown property. </p>
                <h3>Deadly Pirouette</h3>
                    <p>Starting at 7th level, Once on your turn when you score a critical hit with a Flashing Blade weapon, you can make another ranged weapon attack with Flashing Blade weapon that has the thrown property. </p>
            <h2>Level 10<hr></h2>
                <h3>Sanguine Encore</h3>
                    <p>At 10th level, when you deal the extra damage from the Improved Dual Weapon Fighting class feature to a hostile creature, you also deal 1d10 slashing damage each hostile creature within 5 feet of the target. </p>
            <h2>Level 15<hr></h2>
                <h3>Superior Flashing Blades</h3>
                    <p>Starting at 15th level, the bonus damage from Flashing Blade Weapons is increased to 3. </p>
            <h2>Level 18<hr></h2>
                <h3>Finale</h3>
                    <p>At 18th level, you achieve the grand finale of your deadly dance. You can use your action to make an attack against any number of hostile creatures within 20 feet of you, with a separate attack roll for each target. Each time two consecutive attacks hit, you deal the extra damage from the Improved Dual Weapon Fighting class feature to the second target. </p>
                    <p>You cannot use finale on the same turn you Action Surge.</p>
            <h1 id="rytherian"><em>Rytherian Fighter</em></h1>
                <p><em>This fighter uses the practice of perfect timing and prediction to overcome their foes, attacking at just the right time and just the right place.</em></p>
                <h2>Level 3<hr></h2>
                    <h3>Perfect Time</h3>
                        <p>Beginning when you choose this archetype at 3rd level, when a combat encounter starts, you gain the following effects based on the number of rounds that have passed. These effects stack.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>1st round: +1 bonus to attack rolls</li>
                            <li>2nd round: +1 bonus to AC</li>
                            <li>3rd round: +2 bonus to damage rolls</li>
                            <li>4th round: You lose all gained benefits from the 1st to 3rd rounds, and gain disadvantage on attack rolls</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>After the 4th round, the sequence starts over, and you gain the 1st round effect again on the next round. </p>
            <h2>Level 7<hr></h2>
                <h3>Power of Prediction</h3>
                    <p>At 7th level, you can use a bonus action to call out the next immediate maneuver of up to 3 enemies you can see within 15 feet. These maneuvers can be: attack, move, spell cast, or disengage, and you choose one for each enemy. If your prediction is correct, you gain a benefit based on the maneuver made: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Attack: +1 bonus to AC until the end of your next turn.</li>
                        <li>Move: You can make an opportunity attack against the enemy as soon as the enemy moves, not requiring them to move out of your reach first. If this opportunity attack hits, you regain the use of your reaction.</li>
                        <li>Spell Cast: You gain advantage on saving throws against spells until the end of your next turn.</li>
                        <li>Disengage: You heal for 1d10 hit points.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>You can use this ability three times, regaining all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest. </p>
                    <p>In addition, you have advantage on Wisdom (Martial) checks. </p>
            <h2>Level 10<hr></h2>
                <h3>Battle Rhythm</h3>
                    <p>At 10th level, whenever you defeat an enemy, you can freely attack another enemy you have not yet attacked this round. This cannot occur more than twice a round. </p>
            <h2>Level 15<hr></h2>
                <h3>Ebb and Flow</h3>
                    <p>At 15th level, as a free action at the start of your turn, you can choose to double the bonuses you gain from your Perfect Time and Power of Prediction features. If you do, you receive a penalty equal to the bonuses during your next turn. </p>
            <h2>Level 18<hr></h2>
                <h3>Clutch Moment</h3>
                    <p>At 18th level, whenever you hit an attack but before you roll damage, you can choose to have the attack be a critical hit.
