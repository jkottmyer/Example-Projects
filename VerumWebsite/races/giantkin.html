        <h1 style="text-decoration: underline; font-size: 2.5em;">Giant-Kin</h1>
        <h2>Race Description</h2>
        <p>During the second era when the Dwarves labored down below, the surface of Krazax was left mostly untouched. It was then that travelers from across the great ocean settled these mountains. These travelers were the first Giants. Over the course of that era the Giants spread, their form changing from the elements of Verum. Over time these giants took to raiding the humans of the lowlands. It was from their conquest that many half breeds were born, none as common as the Goliath. Because the Goliaths were beings formed from war, they have a culture defined by the primal fury of the giants and the anger of humanity. Though the Giants were pushed back by the Dwarves, the Goliaths remained. Being of two worlds with no place to call their own, the Goliaths formed small tribes within the fringes of civilization where they have remained content living simple, full lives. Most Goliaths seek adventure to proves themselves, to see new things, or due to the natural wanderlust from their ancestors. There are other forms of Giant-kin, but they have yet to be discovered.</p>
        <h2>Racial Information</h2>
        <h3>Anatomy</h3>
        <p>Goliaths in many ways act and live just like humans, albeit a little more brutally. In Goliath society, the strongest are usually right. The best philosophers, thinkers, and politicians are those that headbutt the competition into unconsciousness. Goliaths value strength in all facets of their lives and generally view weakness as a symptom of failure. Goliath courtships differ from their normal human counterparts as well. If a Goliath wedding does not have at least five broken limbs, it is considered a dull affair. </p>
        <p>Firbolg are elves, that when branched off from the orignal race, lived within the more savage wilds, they lived within the mountains and near the old places of power, this primal magic infused them with monstrous size, but their natural demeanors proved to be gentle and loving. Hence an interesting contrast was born, for the same magic that formed the giants, formed the firbolgs but the two could not be more different.</p>
        <h3>Ecology and Habitats </h3>
        <p>The Goliaths live in mountainous regions while Firbolgs tend to live in woodlands.</p>
        <h3>Perception and Sensory Capabilities </h3>
        <p>Standard 5</p>
        <h2>Culture</h2>
        <h3>Major Language Groups and Dialects </h3>
