            <h1>Description</h1>
                <p>A tall human tribesman strides through a blizzard, draped in fur and hefting his axe. He laughs as he charges toward the frost giant who dared poach his people's elk herd.</p>
                <p>A half-orc snarls at the latest challenger to her authority over their savage tribe, ready to break his neck with her bare hands as she did to the last six rivals.</p>   
                <p>Frothing at the mouth, a dwarf slams his helmet into the face of his drow foe, then turns to drive his armored elbow into the gut of another.</p>  
                <p>These barbarians, different as they might be, are defined by their rage: unbridled, unquenchable, and unthinking fury. More than a mere emotion, their anger is the ferocity of a cornered predator, the unrelenting assault of a storm, the churning turmoil of the sea.</p>   
                <p>For some, their rage springs from a communion with fierce animal spirits. Others draw from a roiling reservoir of anger at a world full of pain. For every barbarian, rage is a power that fuels not just a battle frenzy but also uncanny reflexes, resilience, and feats of strength.</p>
            <h1>Primal Instinct</h1>
                <p>People of towns and cities take pride in how their civilized ways set them apart from animals, as if denying one's own nature was a mark of superiority. To a barbarian, though, civilization is no virtue, but a sign of weakness. The strong embrace their animal natureâ€”keen instincts, primal physicality, and ferocious rage. Barbarians are uncomfortable when hedged in by walls and crowds. They thrive in the wilds of their homelands: the tundra, jungle, or grasslands where their tribes live and hunt.</p>
                <p>Barbarians come alive in the chaos of combat. They can enter a berserk state where rage takes over, giving them superhuman strength and resilience. A barbarian can draw on this reservoir of fury only a few times without resting, but those few rages are usually sufficient to defeat whatever threats arise.</p>
            <h1>A Life of Danger</h1>
                <p>Not every member of the tribes deemed "barbarians" by scions of civilized society has the barbarian class. A true barbarian among these people is as uncommon as a skilled fighter in a town, and he or she plays a similar role as a protector of the people and a leader in times of war. Life in the wild places of the world is fraught with peril: rival tribes, deadly weather, and terrifying monsters. Barbarians charge headlong into that danger so that their people don't have to.</p>
                <p>Their courage in the face of danger makes barbarians perfectly suited for adventuring. Wandering is often a way of life for their native tribes, and the rootless life of the adventurer is little hardship for a barbarian. Some barbarians miss the close-knit family structures of the tribe, but eventually find them replaced by the bonds formed among the members of their adventuring parties.</p>
            <h2 style="text-align: center;">Barbarians in Verum follow the same rules as Standard 5e. <a style="font-size: inherit;" href="https://5e.tools/classes.html#barbarian_phb" target="_blank">Official variants</a> are allowed as well as the variant(s) listed below.</h2>
            <h1><em>Scar Seeker</em></h1>
                <p><em>Scar Seekers are recklessness given an artform. Glory seekers, thrill hunters and most of the time absolutely mad. They revel in the damage thier bodies take, each scar a tale that is never forgotten.</em></p>
            <h2>Level 3<hr></h2>
                <h3>Dangerous Bravado</h3>
                    <p>At 3rd level, while you're raging and not wearing heavy armor, you lose any resistance to slashing, piercing, or bludgeoning damage taken, and instead take 50% more damage from those damage types. </p>
            <h3>All In</h3>
                <p>At 3rd level, you gain a bonus to the damage rolls of melee weapon attacks equal to half of the largest amount of damage you have taken in your current rage if you aren't wearing heavy armor. </p>
            <h2>Level 6<hr></h2>
                <h3>Now or Never</h3>
                    <p>At 6th level, you can choose one of your attacks in an attack action, and that attack can score a critical hit on a roll of 15-20. Using this feature provokes an opportunity attack from your target, and their attack can score a critical hit on a roll of 15-20. The target can make this attack even if they do not have a reaction to use but does use their reaction if they haven't used it already. You cannot use this feature again until you finish a short rest.</p>
            <h2>Level 10<hr></h2>
                <h3>Rowdy Rudy</h3>
                    <p>At 10th level, whenever you are defeated, you can instead be reduced to 1 hit point. If you use this feature, all creatures within 30 feet of you gain advantage on attack rolls for 1 round. You cannot use this feature again until you finish a long rest.</p>
            <h2>Level 14<hr></h2>
                <h3>Witness Me!</h3>
                    <p>Starting at 14th level, you can use your action to make the Now or Never attack against all enemies within your reach. Doing so provokes an opportunity attack from each creature as a single target would. If you survive this action, you are healed for half of your maximum hit points.</p>
