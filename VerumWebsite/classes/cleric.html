        <div id="classdescription">
            <h1>Description</h1>
                <p>Arms and eyes upraised toward the sun and a prayer on his lips, an elf begins to glow with an inner light that spills out to heal his battle-worn companions.</p>
                <p>Chanting a song of glory, a dwarf swings his axe in wide swaths to cut through the ranks of orcs arrayed against him, shouting praise to the gods with every foe's fall.</p>
                <p>Calling down a curse upon the forces of undeath, a human lifts her holy symbol as light pours from it to drive back the zombies crowding in on her companions.</p>
                <p>Clerics are intermediaries between the mortal world and the distant planes of the gods. As varied as the gods they serve, clerics strive to embody the handiwork of their deities. No ordinary priest, a cleric is imbued with divine magic.</p>
            <h1>Healers and Warriors</h1>
                <p>Divine magic, as the name suggests, is the power of the gods, flowing from them into the world. Clerics are conduits for that power, manifesting it as miraculous effects. The gods don't grant this power to everyone who seeks it, but only to those chosen to fulfill a high calling.</p>
                <p>Harnessing divine magic doesn't rely on study or training. A cleric might learn formulaic prayers and ancient rites, but the ability to cast cleric spells relies on devotion and an intuitive sense of a deity's wishes.</p>
                <p>Clerics combine the helpful magic of healing and inspiring their allies with spells that harm and hinder foes. They can provoke awe and dread, lay curses of plague or poison, and even call down flames from heaven to consume their enemies. For those evildoers who will benefit most from a mace to the head, clerics depend on their combat training to let them wade into melee with the power of the gods on their side.</p>
            <h1>Divine Agents</h1>
                <p>Not every acolyte or officiant at a temple or shrine is a cleric. Some priests are called to a simple life of temple service, carrying out their gods' will through prayer and sacrifice, not by magic and strength of arms. In some cities, priesthood amounts to a political office, viewed as a stepping stone to higher positions of authority and involving no communion with a god at all. True clerics are rare in most hierarchies.</p>
                <p>When a cleric takes up an adventuring life, it is usually because his or her god demands it. Pursuing the goals of the gods often involves braving dangers beyond the walls of civilization, smiting evil or seeking holy relics in ancient tombs. Many clerics are also expected to protect their deities' worshipers, which can mean fighting rampaging orcs, negotiating peace between warring nations, or sealing a portal that would allow a demon prince to enter the world.</p>
                <p>Most adventuring clerics maintain some connection to established temples and orders of their faiths. A temple might ask for a cleric's aid, or a high priest might be in a position to demand it.</p>
                <h2 style="text-align: center;">Cleric in Verum follow the same rules as Standard 5e. <a style="font-size: inherit;" href="https://5e.tools/classes.html#cleric_phb" target="_blank">Official variants</a> are allowed as well as the variant(s) listed below.</h2>

            <p><em>The swirling random events may seem happenstance to some, luck to others, but you know the truth, it is a force, a deadly, invigorating force behind these occurrences.

            <h2>Taskmaster</h2>
            <p>At 1st level, as an action you can coerce allies to comply with your orders, and for enemies to think twice about attacking you. Choose a number of enemies up to half your proficiency bonus within 60 ft. that you can see. Your allies have advantage on attack rolls against the chosen enemies, but disadvantage on attack rolls against all other creatures until the end of their next turn. The chosen enemies have disadvantage on attack rolls against you until the end of their next turn. Constructs and undead are immune to this effect. You may use this ability a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier, and regain these uses after a long rest.</p>

                        <li>The next time an affected creature would gain advantage on an attack roll, saving throw, or ability check, they lose that advantage, and you gain advantage of the same type the next time you would roll it (if a creature loses advantage on an attack roll, you gain advantage on the next attack roll you make)</li>
                        <li>The next time an affected creature would receive healing, they instead only receive half of it, and you heal for the same amount that they lost</li>
                        <li>The next time an affected creature would cast a spell targeting only you, you regain a spell slot of the same level as the spell cast on you</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>You can receive a benefit from Demand Tribute in this way only once. At 6th level, you can receive two benefits, and three at 18th level.</p>
            <h2>Level 6<hr></h2>
                <h3>Oppression</h3>

                    <p>Once per turn, you may cast the spell Hold Monster as a bonus action on any creature affected by Taskmaster. A creature that fails its save against this effect of Hold Monster is also forced to kneel to you – it is rendered prone.</p>
            <h1 id="undead"><em>Undead</em></h1>
            <p><em>The cycle of life and death is not something that should be kept sacred, but experimented with. You have learned to disrupt this cycle, conjuring spirits and animating corpses to fulfill your will.</em></p>
            <h3>Deities</h3>
            <p>Crowley, The Seven</p>
            <h3>Domain Spells</h3>
            <p>At each indicated cleric level, you add the listed spells to your spells prepared.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>1st - Inflict Wounds, Ray of Sickness</li>

            </ul>
            <h2>Bonus Cantrip</h2>
            <p>At 1st level, you learn one necromancy cantrip from any spell list. For you, this counts a Cleric cantrip.</p>
            <h2>Spectral Smite</h2>
            <p>At 1st level, you can conjure vile spirits from the Ethereal plane to lash out at your foes. When you use your action to cast a spell of 1st level or higher, you may use your bonus action make a melee or ranged spell attack versus one creature you can see within 30 feet. If it hits, that creature suffers necrotic damage equal to 1d6 + your Wisdom Modifier.</p>
            <p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. </p>
                <h3>Channel Divinity: Conjure Undead</h3>
                    <p>Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to summon a horde of skeletons.</p>
                    <p>As an action, you create three horrid skeletons that last 1 minute, or until you lose your concentration (as if you were concentrating on a spell). The skeletons appear in three adjacent unoccupied spaces that you can see within 30 feet of you. Each skeleton has AC equal to 10 + your Wisdom modifier, Hit Points equal to 3 x your cleric level, and uses your saving throws. If a skeleton is dropped to 0 hit points, it crumbles to dust.</p>
                    <p>When you use this ability, you can make a melee spell attack for each skeleton against a creature within 5 feet of each of them. On a hit, the targets take magical slashing damage equal to 1d8 + Wisdom modifier.</p>
                    <p>As an action on each of your turns, you can move each of the skeletons up to 30 feet to a space you can see, but it must remain within 120 feet of you. You may then repeat the attack against a creature within 5 feet of each of the skeletons. The skeletons may move away from one another, can attack separate targets, and take up medium spaces as normal. These skeletons cannot take their own reactions, but you may spend a reaction to grant one of them an opportunity attack if one such attack is provoked.</p>
            <h2>Level 6<hr></h2>
                <h3>Corpse Companion</h3>
                    <p>At 6th level, you learn to raise a permanent undead minion to do your bidding.</p>
                    <p>With an 8 hour ritual and the expenditure of 50 gp worth of rare herbs, you raise a single medium humanoid corpse to serve as your companion. Select your companion from one of the two following creatures: Skeleton or Zombie. At the end of the 8 hours, your corpse companion is raised. You can have only one corpse companion at a time.</p>
                    <p>If your corpse companion is ever slain, you may reactivate the vile magics within it to reanimate it. With an 8 hours ritual and the expenditure of 25 gp worth of rare herbs, you call forth your companion and reanimate its lifeless corpse. You must possess the companion’s body in order to reanimate it in this way.</p>
                    <p>Your corpse companion gains the following bonuses while it is controlled by you:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The companion obeys your commands as best it can. It rolls for initiative like any other creature, but you determine its actions. If you are incapacitated or absent, your companion does not act on its own.</li>
                        <li>Your companion has base hit points equal to 5 times your cleric level. If it is reduced to 0 hit points, it makes death saving throws as normal. It has proficiency with simple weapons and light armor, but has no attunement slots. Your companion uses your proficiency bonus rather than its own. In addition to the areas where it normally uses its proficiency bonus, a corpse companion also adds its proficiency bonus to its AC and to its damage rolls and gains proficiency with all saving throws. Finally, you may increase one of its ability scores by 2, or increase two ability scores 1.</li>
                        <li>Your corpse companion cannot spend hit dice or be healed by any effect that does not heal undead. It returns to full hit points on a long rest as normal. Whenever you cast Inflict Wounds on your corpse companion, it heals a number of hit points equal to the damage that would have been dealt rather than taking damage.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>For each cleric level you gain after 6th, your corpse companion gains an additional hit die and increases its hit points by 5 + its Constitution Modifier.</p>
                    <p>Whenever you gain the Ability Score Improvement class feature, your companion's abilities also improve. Your companion can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or it can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, your companion can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature unless its description specifies otherwise.</p>
            <h2>Level 8<hr></h2>
                <h3>Potent Spellcasting</h3>
                    <p>Starting at 8th level, you add your Wisdom modifier to the damage you deal with any cleric cantrip.</p>
            <h2>Level 17<hr></h2>
                <h3>Undead Lord</h3>
                    <p>At 17th level, any undead creatures you animate or summon with a necromancy spell add your proficiency bonus to their saving throws, attack rolls, damage rolls, and AC. This does not apply to your Corpse Companion.</p>
                    <p>As an action, you may destroy your Corpse Companion, rendering it to dust. When you do so, you regain a number of Hit Points equal to the number of Hit Points it had remaining. Any equipment your companion had falls to its space unharmed. This ability can be used at any range, but you and your corpse companion must be on the same plane.</p>
