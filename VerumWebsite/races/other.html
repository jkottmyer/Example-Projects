        <h1 style="text-decoration: underline; font-size: 2.5em;">Dhampir</h1>
        <h2>Race Description</h2>
        <p>Dhampirs are humanoids that have a partial connection to the curse of Vampirism. While not full vampires themselves, they carry many of the same burdens but also have some of the same gifts.</p>
        <h2>Racial Information</h2>
        <h3>Anatomy </h3>
        <p>Dhampir stand near the same height of most humans, rarely standing taller than a height of 6 feet.</p>
        <h3>Ecology and Habitats </h3>
        <p>Dhampir can live anywhere that other humanoids live, but personal aversions or the superstition of others may cause them to seek isolated, private or seedy places.</p>
        <h3>Dietary Needs and Habits </h3>
        <p>Omnivorous, but must periodically consume the blood of humanoids to avoid physical and mental illness.</p>
        <h3>Facial characteristics </h3>
        <p>Dhampir have fangs, similar to a vampire.</p>
        <h3>Average Intelligence </h3>
        <p>10</p>
        <h3>Perception and Sensory Capabilities </h3>
        <p>The basic five, with the ability to see in the dark.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="racedescription" style="margin-top: 10px;">
        <h1>Dhampir</h1>
        <p><b>Ability Score Increase: </b>Your ability score increases are determined by your subrace. </p>
        <p><b>Size: </b>Medium</p>
        <p><b>Speed: </b>30 feet</p>
        <p><b>Age: </b>Similarly to humans, Dhampir reach adulthood in their late teens, but due to their curse live no longer than 140 years. </p>
        <p><b>Alignment: </b>Due to the nature of their curse, Dhampir tend to be more self centered and focused more on their own personal gain and survival. Some bend the law or take advantage of it to fit their needs, while others completely circumvent the law to fulfill their desires. There are however, few Dhampir that seek to redeem themselves from their curse, taking selfless actions and only partaking in blood when necessary. </p>
        <p><b>Undead: </b>A Dhampir detects as undead for spells and effects. This only counts for spells that detect undead.</p>
        <p><b>Darkvision : </b>You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. </p>
        <p><b>Sunlight Sensitivity: </b>You have disadvantage on attack rolls and on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight when you, the target of your attack, or whatever you are trying to perceive is in direct sunlight. </p>
        <p><b>Vampiric Guile: </b>You gain proficiency with one of the following skills of your choice: Deception, Intimidation, or Persuasion. </p>
        <p><b>Blood Curse: </b>Once per week, Dhampirs must partake in the blood of another humanoid in order to replace their own blood to survive. If a Dhampir fails to do so, they gain one point of exhaustion per day afterwards that cannot be removed until they consume the blood of another humanoid. </p>
        <p><b>Fangs: </b>Your fangs are a natural weapon which you can use to make unarmed strikes. Your fangs count as a finesse weapon, and as such if you hit with it, you deal piercing damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength or Dexterity modifier. </p>
        <p><b>Invigorate: </b>Once per long rest, when you successfully attack a living humanoid with blood using your fangs, you can spend one Hit Die to heal yourself (no action required). Roll the die, add your Constitution modifier, and regain a number of hit points equal to the total. Using this ability counts as a source of blood for the blood curse effect.</p>
        <p><b>Subraces: </b>All Dhampir have different aspects of their curse more pronounced, creating two distinct types: Feral Dhampirs, and Royal Dhampirs. The subraces are as follows: </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Feral Dhampir</b></li>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Ability Score Improvement: </b>Your Dexterity score increases by +2 and your Charisma score increases by +1. </li>
                <li><b>Blood Frenzy: </b>Consuming the blood of the living in excess imbues you with power, and embracing it allows for you to enter a state of rage and fervor. Whenever you successfully strike a creature with blood using your fangs, you may choose to enter a Blood Frenzy. Until the end of your turn, you may use a bonus action to make a fang attack against a target. If you succeed on this or any other fang attack on your turn, you may extend the duration of your frenzy by one additional round. If your frenzy was extended by one or more rounds, you gain one point of exhaustion when your frenzy ends. </li>
            </ul>
            <li><b>Royal Dhampir</b></li>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Ability Score Improvement: </b>Your Charisma score increases by +2 and your Dexterity score increases by +1. </li>
                <li><b>Predatory Charm: </b>You can magically beguile the mind of creatures, twisting their perception of you. You can cast the spell Charm Person once with this trait. At 7th level, you can cast the spell Charm Monster with this trait instead. You regain the ability to cast it this way when you finish a long rest. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for this spell.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Languages: </b>You can speak, read, and write Common and Necrill.</p>

        <h1 style="text-decoration: underline; font-size: 2.5em;">Revenant</h1>
        <h2>Race Description</h2>
        <p>A mockery of life, a Revenant is an undead husk of a formerly living creature. Revenants require battle to survive and thus feed off a small portion of the energy that a living being released once it is killed. Without a constant supply of combat and violence a Revenant will cease to be.</p>
        <h2>Racial Information</h2>
        <h3>Anatomy </h3>
        <p>Revenants resemble the creature they once were but have few of the basic internal biological functions their body once did, and those that remain are usually just to maintain a sense of equilibrium.</p>
        <h3>Biological Traits </h3>
        <p>A revenant is undead and have many features as expected of an undead. A revenant still needs to breathe, this is for its mind not its body, as it will lose its grip on its body and be destroyed if it does not keep breathing. A revenant does not need to eat or drink anymore however.</p>
        <h3>Genetics and Reproduction </h3>
        <p>Revenants cannot reproduce by their own means - at least as far as anyone knows.</p>
        <h3>Growth Rate & Stages </h3>
        <p>Revenants are returned complete, they do not grow.</p>
        <h3>Ecology and Habitats </h3>
        <p>Revenants live anywhere that battle, strife and death can be in easy access.</p>
        <h3>Dietary Needs and Habits </h3>
        <p>Revenants need not eat or drink.</p>
        <h3>Facial characteristics </h3>
        <p>Variable</p>
        <h3>Average Intelligence </h3>
        <p>Variable</p>
        <h3>Perception and Sensory Capabilities </h3>
        <p>The same as the host</p>
        <h2>Culture</h2>
        <h3>Common Customs, Traditions and Rituals </h3>
        <p>Revenants require constant battle and bloodshed to continue to live.</p>
        <h3>Common Taboos </h3>
        <p>For a Revenant, peace would mean death. Pacifism would mean certain doom, so those who wish to continue existing would avoid it.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="racedescription" style="margin-top: 10px;">
        <h1>Revenant</h1>
        <p><b>Ability Score Increase: </b>Constitution +4</p>
        <p><b>Size: </b>Medium</p>
        <p><b>Speed: </b>30 feet</p>
        <p><b>Age: </b>Revenants live only as long as they continue to kill worthy adversaries. Their life is extended by the purpose of battle, righteous or otherwise. Many dedicate themselves to a purpose, in which they throw all of themselves into it. </p>
        <p><b>Alignment: </b>A Revenants alignment often times resembles that which it had at death. </p>
        <p><b>Breathing Corpse: </b>A revenant is undead and is affected by negative effects and positive effects that affect undead, any healing the Revenant receives is always halved, regardless of its source. They however cannot be turned or commanded with the relative class features to those effects. A revenant still needs to breath, this is for its mind not its body, as it will lose its grip on its body and be destroyed if it does not keep breathing. (They suffocate like everyone else.) A revenant does not need to eat or drink anymore however. </p>
        <p><b>On the Edge: </b>The revenant's soul is just on the edge of passing and just within its bodies reach. On a death saving throw, if a Revenant rolls a 15 – 20, they are healed by 1 hitpoint and may act normally. If they roll a 1 on a death saving throw, they are automatically destroyed. </p>
        <p><b>Battle will sustain thee: </b>Whenever the Revenant gets a KILLING BLOW on an enemy, they gain 1 soul point. As time passes the Revenant loses soul points. If a revenant does not have enough soul points equal to that which is lost, they must make a death saving throw to continue living. They must make this save for each soul point they don't have. If they fail three of these before the next time they gain the KILLING BLOW, they are destroyed. If they roll a 1 during these, they are instantly destroyed. </p>
        <p><b>What is Dead, may never die: </b>Revenants are immune to death effects and necrotic damage, but they may never be revived or resurrected again. </p>
        <p><b>Languages: </b>Revenants speak whatever languages they knew when they died and they gain Necril.</p>

        <h2>Race Description</h2>
        <p>Sirens spawn themselves from emotions of other creatures and feed on them for their sustenance.</p>
        <h2>Racial Information</h2>
        <h3>Anatomy </h3>
        <p>Humanoid</p>
        <h3>Growth Rate & Stages </h3>
        <p>A Siren is a species of aberration that seeks to feed on the emotions of other creatures and when possible, spawn themselves from such emotions. Sirens reach maturity at 18 and can live up to 500 years.</p>

        <p><b>Size: </b>Medium</p>
        <p><b>Speed: </b>30 feet</p>
        <p><b>Age: </b>A Siren is a species of aberration that seeks to feed on the emotions of other creatures and when possible, spawn themselves from such emotions. Sirens can live up to 500 years. </p>
        <p><b>Alignment: </b>Most Sirens have a chaotic alignment, the conventions of law limiting to their feeding. However, good and evil is dependent on the sirens cultural sub-type, but Sirens of course can choose their own paths. </p>
        <p><b>Size: </b>Sirens are on average the same size as humans. Your size is Medium. </p>
        <p><b>Darkvision : </b>You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You cannot discern color in darkness, only shades of grey. </p>
        <p><b>The Voice: </b>All Sirens can sing, indeed it is their method of feeding and a great tool to their survival. As such, all Sirens have proficiency in the performance skill. </p>
        <p><b>The Feeding: </b>Sirens feed on the powerful emotions of those around them, with each sub-type of Siren preferring to gain sustenance from a particular emotion, and usually maneuver or manipulate their prey in order to achieve the optimal conditions. </p>
        <p>As a bonus action, a Siren can begin to sing through The Voice in order to draw sustenance out from a target creature they can see afflicted with their preferred status condition (see each sub-race for their chosen status effect), gaining 10 Temporary Hit Points as a result. </p>
        <p>This method of feeding counts as enough sustenance to last a Siren a full week, though they still require water as normal. </p>
        <p> Once you have used this ability, you must complete a Long Rest before you can use it again. </p>
        <p><b>Communion: </b>Upon completion of a short or long rest, you can choose a number of allies up to your proficiency modifier to commune with, granting them a boon for combat. This boon is lost upon the target completing another short or long rest. </p>
        <p>As an action, you can call out and activate the effects of the communion on any effected ally within 60ft that can hear you. This benefit lasts for 1 minute. </p>
