        <h1 style="text-decoration: underline; font-size: 2.5em;">Lizardfolk</h1>
        <h2>Race Description</h2>
        <p>Whereas elves and dwarves were given long lives, the Lizardfolk of Khao learned to survive. Their shorter lifespans and more primal forms lead them to create a simple yet more effective culture. As the elves took to the mainland and the dwarves took the mountains, the Lizardfolk took to the the jungles of Khao; hidden among the flora of the jungles, Lizardfolk were able to thrive in isolation. The jungles of Khao are vast giving plenty of space for Lizardfolk to expand and tribalize. Their beliefs spawned a spiritual connection and the creation of the spirits that they now server today. Being more akin to the natural world, the Lizardfolk have a more innate connection with the Green Pantheon and with the forces of nature. The Lizardfolk squabbled among themselves until nearly the end of the first age when the first and only lizard king was named: Ga’alathel (Ga-A-La-Thel). He lead his people to conquer the remaining area of Khao and to build a civilization that is mostly unknown to the rest of the world. However, this ancient civilization disappeared nearly as quickly as it rose by an unseen calamity. Today, Lizardfolk carry with them the primal lessons of their past and a quick and adaptable ingenuity. They are survivors at heart, above all else.</p>
        <h2>Racial Information</h2>
        <h3>Anatomy</h3>
        <p>Scaled bipedal humanoids</p>
        <h3>Biological Traits </h3>
        <p>Lizardfolk is a general term that describes three different races: Saurian, which are the traditional Lizardfolk, Kobold, and Yuan-Ti. They each have a variety of different characteristics, but all of them are cold blooded, lack eyelids, and have a cultural indifference to the concept of cannibalism. </p>
        <p>Kobolds are an offshoot strain of lesser Saurian Lizardfolk. It is unclear why they diminished in size, but they did so rapidly to the point that the Kobold tribes were considered separate from the Saurian. Due to their shorter lifespan, the Kobolds are wilder in nature than their Saurian counterpart which is why they are considered vermin by many races. </p>
        <p>As there are many spirits that the Lizardfolk worship, none are more sinister than the unnamed serpent. This being took a tribe of Lizardfolk for itself and transformed them into the terrible Yuan-Ti. The Yuan-Ti are among the least trustworthy of all Lizardfolk and yet have taken the greatest leaps and attempts toward assimilation into other civilizations. It’s a common rumor that Yuan-Ti are cultist for this unknown entity, but no true evidence exists.</p>
        <h3>Genetics and Reproduction </h3>
        <p>Egg-Laying</p>
        <h3>Ecology and Habitats </h3>
        <p>Since the fall of their civilization, Lizardfolk have spread across the world and can be found anywhere. Although, high concentrations can be found in the jungles of Khao, the swamps of Dolten, and the coasts of Bloodwave Bay.</p>
        <h3>Dietary Needs and Habits </h3>
        <p>Omnivorous, but can survive under a carnivorous lifestyle.</p>
        <h3>Facial characteristics </h3>
        <p>Scaled</p>
        <h3>Geographic Origin and Distribution </h3>
        <p>High concentrations can be found in the jungles of Khao, the swamps of Dolten, and the coasts of Bloodwave Bay.</p>
        <h3>Average Intelligence </h3>
        <p>10</p>
        <h3>Perception and Sensory Capabilities </h3>
        <p>The 5 main senses, with some being capable of enhanced scent or sight.</p>
        <h2>Culture</h2>
        <h3>Major Language Groups and Dialects </h3>
        <p>Draconic (Claw)</p>
        <h3>Common Customs, Traditions and Rituals </h3>
        <p>The Lizardfolk are alien the most in a single shared belief that is not shared by any other races; meat is meat, and once a creature dies, it becomes fuel for others. Spiritually speaking, other races have various rituals that provide appeasement for the soul of the fallen. To a Lizardfolk, those that die are granted immortality by feeding other life. This difference in belief above all others has caused the most conflict for the Lizardfolk. It is important to note that cannibalism refers to the consumption of any sentient creature. It is not considered an evil act for a Lizardfolk to cannibalize another sentient creature as long as that creature was already dead. A Lizardfolk who kills another sentient creature with the express purpose of eating them is not participating in an evil act, although this is not a supported action for most Lizardfolk tribes.</p>
        <h3>History </h3>
        <p>The Lizardfolk squabbled among themselves until nearly the end of the first age when the first and only lizard king was named: Ga’alathel (Ga-A-La-Thel). He lead his people to conquer the remaining area of Khao and to build a civilization that is mostly unknown to the rest of the world. However, this ancient civilization disappeared nearly as quickly as it rose by an unseen calamity. Today, Lizardfolk carry with them the primal lessons of their past and a quick and adaptable ingenuity. They are survivors at heart, above all else.</p>
        <h3>Historical Figures </h3>
        <p>Ga’alathel</p>
        <h3>Common Myths and Legends </h3>
        <p>There is a belief among the Kobolds that one of the Seven was their own. Although this cannot be proven, most Kobolds believe it with all of their hearts.</p>
