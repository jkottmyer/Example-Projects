        <h1 style="text-decoration: underline; font-size: 2.5em;">Dolten</h1>
        <h2>Structure</h2>
        <p>Dolten's government is separated into two pieces, the public face of a council of nobles which run day to day operations; however, the true heart of the Doltenian government is a shadow government of witches of the Great Coven. Although this is supposedly a secret, it's a fact everyone knows but never speaks aloud.</p>
        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>Dolten is a place rife with peril and mystery, it has always been so. Long ago in the first era when the forests of what would be called Dolten were formed, was home to the mighty Linnorms great primordial dragons who fought over territory and hunted the animals in the old ways. It was during this time that the dragons from Dragonstar attacked, invaders swept over the sky and war came to Verum for the first time. The Linnorms fought these invaders but most were slain resulting in the dragons being weakened; as such, both races spent centuries to recover while the elves began to spread their dominion. Dolten itself was forever changed by the blood of Linnorms spilling into the earth. The forest grew more primal, its beasts began to warp and change. Woe'tanclast the white Linnorm was perhaps the most impactful, for she was the wife and only love of Crovux father of Linnorms it was from her blood which a single spider was swept up in the spider survived and was forever changed and with its survival one of Dolten's most notorious threats was born The Creeping Death. The lands of Dolten continued to be a place of danger and death all throughout the eras. That was until finally a group of desperate settlers paid the price to live there, in blood and will. It was from these first settlers and the witches that aided them, that the land was somewhat tamed allowing for civilization to against all odds thrive.</p>
        <h2>Demography and Population </h2>
        <p>The population of Dolten is relatively diverse with a focus on humans, gnomes and elves. In addition to these Dolten is the primary home of skinwalkers and any race of which is difficult to look upon.</p>
        <h2>Territories</h2>
        <p>Dolten is a temperate region, heavily forested with a swamp and a few large scattered rivers. The southern tip is a barren land of shale rock and alchemical industry.</p>
        <h2>Military</h2>
        <p>The military branch of Dolten is controlled and manned nearly entirely by the Night Guard, they patrol the perimeter of the country and keep a constant look out from their fortress, the Crimson Citadel. The World Wanderers assist them intimately via the world roads through the deadly forests of Dolten.</p>
        <h2>Technological Level </h2>
        <p>Dolten is a sporadically advancing nation in terms of scientific advancement. Parts still cling to the old tribal methods that they have practiced for centuries; this is especially true amongst the skinwalkers, some take to the full development of marble and stone and hope it will stand against the wrath of the forest. In Bleak the advancements rival that of even Khao, while their advances in planar binding rival that of even the old mages guild.</p>
        <h2>Religion</h2>
        <p>The primary religions of Dolten are nearly entirely dominated by the Patrons beings with little form or dogma leading to a pseudo-spiritualism, of the dominant religions of the world the Green Pantheon is the most common.</p>
        <h2>Origin Bonus</h2>
        <p>Dolten is a land wrought with danger and darkness. Nevertheless, there are those that make their home here. Living side by side with the dark things that go bump in the night. Thriving within the dark forest, the Abhorrent Arboreal. All Doltenians receive the following benefits and may choose a sub Origin for additional abilities. </p>
        <ul>

            <li>Darkness lives within a Doltenian's soul. This taint marks them and empowers them. Each of the sub origins presents a +1 to an ability score but also a burden the character must carry.</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Bleak Blessed</h1>
        <p>Far to the south in Dolten, there is a land devoid of vegetation, where the sun is blocked by ash. The air choked with pollution. However, in this place their sits a city, a city filled with its own brand of horrible wonders. From a chained Balor, fueling the cities furnaces and home heating, to the tortured Solar that lights the homes of it’s citizens. Bleak is filled with things to make the imagination run wild. A place of technology and dark magics. Bleak has no usable natural resources and so has grown into a place of trade. Providing those that would trade food, with products scoured by it’s planar inhabitants. These beings regardless of their origin are second class citizens at best and slaves at worst. Bound by contracts or refugees from their own homes, these outsiders have found a horrible home, but a home nonetheless. </p>
        <p>You grew up on these sickly streets. Rich or poor, outsider or normal, Bleak offers a series of gifts to those that live and live well. The strange power of the land also waits inside of you. Eager for release. </p>

Their have been many children that have gone missing do to the strange actions of the Fae. However, even though many are stolen, some make thier back home. But even though they may return, these children are forever changed. </p>

        <h1>Gambler Born</h1>
        <p>One of the most infamous voyages in Verum’s history, is also one of the shortest. In an attempt to cross the abyssal ocean a brilliant shipwright spent 20 years of his life to create the largest ship the world had ever seen. A ship so large it resembled a small city. Upon its maiden voyage the great ship left the tiny dock, along with its population of passengers. The ship made it merely a mile outside of the country before it collapsed in on itself. The ship sank, but was so large that the top half still juts out of the water. Like a forlorn island on the sea, so has the Grinning Gambler rested. To this day, it has served as a refuge to criminals and the like. A home for any that are brave enough to find their way. </p>
        <p>It was here, among the squalor and the decks that you were born. Life here has been hard, but you were always a sharp one. Quick in mind and body, you avoided the dangers and even thrived. You picked up many tricks and trades among the denizens of the Grinning Gambler, and even, a little bit of it’s dark luck. </p>

            </ul>
            <li>Corruption Effect - Sometimes bad luck is even worse and even more so for you. Whenever you would roll a 2 on an attack roll, saving throw, or skill check, it counts as though you rolled a 1.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="left">
        <h1>Gravewatcher</h1>
        <p>Gravewatch is a city built on the precipice of an ancient battle in Dolten’s history. The Crimson Citadel sits as a lonely testament to the lives lost on this ancient battlefield. So large was the death toll, that this mass grave was never scoured, bodies never returned, souls trapped within the land. As such the landscape changed and adapted to this necrotic host. </p>
        <p>You were born here, in this city of mourning, where the dead rising is a common and dangerous occurrence. As such you have attained abilities to live and thrive among the dead.</p>

        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="left">

        <p>The night in Dolten is overpowering. However, there are those that have trained their entire lives to face it, if necessary. A Night Guard Aspirant may come from any place within Dolten, but it is their unshaking will that defines them. You have come to their sacred academy to better yourself and Dolten’s future. You have come to test yourself in the Crimson Crucible, to become a Night Guard. </p>

        <h1>The Skittering</h1>
        <p>Those that live within the Webwood have respect and fear for the spider. To some, this may seem silly, but those who have witnessed the Creeping Death’s terrible fury, know otherwise. </p>
        <p>You were born here in these woven woods. Staking out a living from the thread left behind by The Creeping Death. As frightening as it may seem, the living is quite profitable as the clothing tailored from it, all the world demands. Throughout your life, you have found a way to survive by timing, caution and respecting the spider. </p>
        <p>You always keep a look out for spiders, as spider silk is rare and sells for quite the profit. </p>

        <p>Life in the big city depends on the city. Witchtown is the capital of Dolten and is the most secure in its place among the trees. Ruled by the council of the tower, the denizens of Dolten live in relative safety and prosperity. However, like all places in Dolten, Witchtown has its secrets. </p>
        <p>Being an orphan in Witchtown means you were taken care of by the state and as such, you were exposed to many things in the slums of this city. Exposed to terrors most are unaware of, the biggest being the Witches who truly rule Witchtown and all of Dolten. They took you in, fed you, clothed you. They also showed you dark truths and darker powers. As such, you were a Ward of Witchtown, the closest thing to a noble in Dolten. A true noble that is. </p>
