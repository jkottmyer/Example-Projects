        <h1 style="text-decoration: underline; font-size: 2.5em;">Daborak</h1>
        <p><em>Daborak is a land of lush wheat fields, flat plains and wild rivers. An otherwise temperate land, lush for farming which provides Kalakatesh with a larger portion than normal of its food.</em></p>
        <h2>Structure</h2>
        <p>Daborak is ruled by martial law, through a totalitarian military government, that awards rank based on merit. This means that social advancement is quite common in Daborak. Although only on the merits of one's ability to perform in combat.</p>
        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>Daborak was once a collection of city-states, constantly fighting over control of various resources within the fertile fields. This constant competition is believed to be what led to the development of their tactics and general knowledge. Eventually the city-states combined their efforts to face a much greater threat, a contingent of lizardfolk set on conquering the lands of Daborak. The loss of life numbered in the tens of thousands, before finally, the lizardfolk returned to their jungle homes empty-handed. In their weakened state, the Daborakian's feared a counter attack and immediately banded together in one nation to supply a centralized army. When no counterattack came, the people decided to continue with their government; the security and prosperity it provided was preferred to the constant turmoil of war.</p>
        <h2>Demography and Population </h2>
        <p>Daborak is dominantly human, although half-elves and half-orcs are the most common among the remainder of the races.</p>
        <h2>Military</h2>
        <p>The Daborakian military is one of the most prominent in Kalkatesh and its cavalry is undoubtedly the deadliest. There are few things more terrifying than a Daborakian cavalry charge. Besides that, they are an extremely well-organized military, challenged in their soldering skill perhaps only by Krazax. Daborakian warhorses are so valued that they are granted the ability to own property and hold titles of nobility.</p>
        <h2>Religion</h2>
        <p>Glory is the most common deity worshipped within Daborak. Other commonly worshipped are Iass, Astaroth and Tilt. The Seven are prominent as always.</p>
        <h2>Agriculture and Industry </h2>
        <p>Daborak is heavily developed in siege engines, but by far, their greatest advancements are in those of its animal husbandry. Using proper breeding and magic infusions, the horses of Dabnorak were granted intelligence and have the ability to understand spoken language and can communicate through a language called Cantor by stomping their hooves. The longer a Daborakian warhorse lives the more intelligent it becomes, some of their paragons possess the ability to actually speak.</p>
        <h2>Origin Bonus</h2>
        <p>Daborak is a warrior nation, built on military service, discipline, courage and horses. All of its citizenry are trained, at least to some degree, in warfare.
