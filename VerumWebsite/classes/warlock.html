            <h1>Description</h1>
                <p>With a pseudodragon curled on his shoulder, a young elf in golden robes smiles warmly, weaving a magical charm into his honeyed words and bending the palace sentinel to his will.</p>
                <p>As flames spring to life in her hands, a wizened human whispers the secret name of her demonic patron, infusing her spell with fiendish magic.</p>   
                <p>Shifting his gaze between a battered tome and the odd alignment of the stars overhead, a wild-eyed tiefling chants the mystic ritual that will open a doorway to a distant world.</p>
                <p>Warlocks are seekers of the knowledge that lies hidden in the fabric of the multiverse. Through pacts made with mysterious beings of supernatural power, warlocks unlock magical effects both subtle and spectacular. Drawing on the ancient knowledge of beings such as fey nobles, demons, devils, hags, and alien entities of the Far Realm, warlocks piece together arcane secrets to bolster their own power.</p>
            <h1>Sworn and Beholden</h1>
                <p>A warlock is defined by a pact with an otherworldly being. Sometimes the relationship between warlock and patron is like that of a cleric and a deity, though the beings that serve as patrons for warlocks are not gods. A warlock might lead a cult dedicated to a demon prince, an archdevil, or an utterly alien entity—beings not typically served by clerics. More often, though, the arrangement is similar to that between a master and an apprentice. The warlock learns and grows in power, at the cost of occasional services performed on the patron's behalf.</p>
                <p>The magic bestowed on a warlock ranges from minor but lasting alterations to the warlock's being (such as the ability to see in darkness or to read any language) to access to powerful spells. Unlike bookish wizards, warlocks supplement their magic with some facility at hand-to-hand combat. They are comfortable in light armor and know how to use simple weapons.</p>
            <h1>Delvers Into Secrets</h1>
                <p>Warlocks are driven by an insatiable need for knowledge and power, which compels them into their pacts and shapes their lives. This thirst drives warlocks into their pacts and shapes their later careers as well.</p>
                <p>Stories of warlocks binding themselves to fiends are widely known. But many warlocks serve patrons that are not fiendish. Sometimes a traveler in the wilds comes to a strangely beautiful tower, meets its fey lord or lady, and stumbles into a pact without being fully aware of it. And sometimes, while poring over tomes of forbidden lore, a brilliant but crazed student's mind is opened to realities beyond the material world and to the alien beings that dwell in the outer void.</p>
                <p>Once a pact is made, a warlock's thirst for knowledge and power can't be slaked with mere study and research. No one makes a pact with such a mighty patron if he or she doesn't intend to use the power thus gained. Rather, the vast majority of warlocks spend their days in active pursuit of their goals, which typically means some kind of adventuring. Furthermore, the demands of their patrons drive warlocks toward adventure.</p>
                <h2 style="text-align: center;">Warlocks in Verum follow the same rules as Standard 5e. <a style="font-size: inherit;" href="https://5e.tools/classes.html#warlock_phb" target="_blank">Official variants</a> are allowed as well as the variant(s) listed below.</h2>
            <h1><em>The Evil Eye</em></h1>
                <p><em>Your patron is a being of misfortune, misery, sorrow, and devastation. You bring ruin to hope and cast down those who believe that they are destined for success. You are no mere fool with a few magic words. You shall cast an evil eye, and spit your name upon the truth. </em></p>
                <p>Expanded spell list:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>1st - Bane, Disguise Self</li>
                    <li>2nd - Silence, Pass Without Trace</li>
                    <li>3rd - Bestow Curse, Slow</li>
                    <li>4th - Confusion, Greater Invisibility</li>
                    <li>5th - Modify Memory, Passwall</li>
                </ul>
            <h2>Level 1<hr></h2>
                <h3>Evil Eye</h3>
                    <p>Starting at 1st level, your patron grants you the ability to manifest a small portion of its power on the material plane. As a bonus action you can designate a creature you can see within 30 feet to suffer the effects of the Evil Eye. That creature must make a Charisma saving throw against your Warlock spell save DC. For 1 minute, whenever a target that fails this saving throw makes an attack roll or saving throw before this feature ends, the target must roll a d4 and subtract the result from the attack roll or saving throw. This functions identically to the Bane spell (though it does not require concentration) and does not stack with it. This feature cannot be active on more than one creature at a time. This ability can be used a number of times per day equal to your Charisma Modifier (Minimum of 1), regaining expended uses on a long rest.</p>
            <h2>Level 6<hr></h2>
                <h3>Blessed Gaze</h3>
                    <p>Starting at 6th level, whenever a creature suffers the effects of your Evil Eye ability, you gain a bonus to the next d20 roll of your choice equal to the result of the d4 that creature rolled. This boon fades at the end of your next turn. (It does not stack with itself) Additionally you gain an additional use of Evil Eye per day. </p>
            <h2>Level 10<hr></h2>
                <h3>Inescapable Sight</h3>
                    <p>Starting at 10th level, whenever your Evil Eye ability activates, the result of the penalty is equal to your proficiency bonus. Additionally all creatures that must save against a Bane spell cast use a Warlock spell slot or Eldritch Invocation suffer disadvantage. Additionally you gain an additional use of Evil Eye per day. </p>
            <h2>Level 14<hr></h2>
                <h3>True Eye</h3>
                    <p>Starting at 14th level, whenever you inflict a creature with your Evil Eye ability, choose one of the following: Attack Rolls, Ability Checks, Saving Throws. The creature suffers disadvantage on any roll of the selected type it makes. This can only be balanced by advantage originating from a magical source or class feature used by a creature of the same proficiency bonus as you. Additionally you gain an additional use of Evil Eye per day.</p>
            <h2>Evil Eye Eldritch Invocations<hr></h2>
                <p>Eye See You: A creature under the effects of your evil eye suffers disadvantage on all stealth checks while within 120 feet of you, and you ignore partial cover when targeting that creature.</p>
                <p>Jinx - 5th level: You expend your reaction to interfere with the actions of an opponent. Select one enemy creature that you can see. That creature must make a Wisdom saving throw equal to your Warlock Spell DC. If they fail, they suffer disadvantage on their next d20 roll. Once a creature suffers the effects of this Invocation, they cannot be affected by it again until you take a long rest. </p>
                <p>Assassin of Fate - 7th level: You can cast Bane a number of times per day equal to your proficiency modifier without expending a spell slot or material components. You recover these uses on a long rest. </p>
            <h1><em>Lunar</em></h1>
                <p><em>In the hours between the twilight, a great creature glides through the air. Žvaigždė (Pronounced ZHE-ve-gs-Des), a creature of the night, stars and watcher of those placed where the material world and the Great Dream blur, is a lunar dragon - quite possibly the last of her kind. Certainly, nobody else has ever seen another - and very precious few have ever even seen Žvaigždė. The only reason any know of her come from footnotes and obscure stories in Sevenic lore. Still, it is said that she visits people as they sleep and their thoughts wander in the Great Dream - or perhaps become lost deep in the dream before their time. She is bound by rules made by her own will and the command of others, as such the limits to what she can do in the material world, kindly and wise as she is, are limited. To that end, she has become able by her own choice or the choice of forces external to make pacts with creatures. There was little she could do ease the burdens of humanoid-kind during the Reckoning, and she has promised to use the limited means available to her to try and help prevent such a thing from coming to pass once again.</em></p>
                <p>Expanded spell list:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>1st - Guiding Bolt, Sleep</li>
                    <li>2nd - Darkvision, Moonbeam</li>
                    <li>3rd - Catnap, Melf's Minute Meteors</li>
                    <li>4th - Freedom of Movement, Phantasmal Killer</li>
                    <li>5th - Commune with Nature, Wall of Force</li>
                </ul>
            <h2>Level 1<hr></h2>
                <h3>Blessing of the Moon</h3>
                    <p>At first level, you gain the Light and Sacred Flame cantrips, they count as Warlock cantrips for you, but don’t count against your number of Cantrips known. Additionally, when you cast a warlock spell that deals radiant or necrotic damage, you add your Charisma modifier to one radiant or necrotic damage roll of that spell against one of its targets. </p>
            <h2>Level 6<hr></h2>
                <h3>Lunar Armor</h3>
                    <p>At 6th level, you are able to conjure a spectral armor made of moonlight and starstuff. This armor functions as the spell Mage Armor, setting your AC to 13+your Dexterity modifier. This is considered to also function as Armor of Shadows for purposes of other class/character features. </p>
                    <p>Additionally, while using this armor, you gain the ability to lash out at enemies with radiant damage. You have a pool of d6s that you spend to fuel this ability. The number of dice in the pool equals 1 + your warlock level. As a reaction, whenever a creature that you can see successfully damages you with a melee, ranged, or spell attack that targets your armor class, you may cause them to suffer radiant damage, spending dice from the pool. The maximum number of dice you can spend at once equals half your warlock level. Roll the dice you spend and add them together to determine the total amount of damage. </p>
                    <p>our pool regains all expended dice when you finish a long rest. </p>
            <h2>Level 10<hr></h2>
                <h3>Grace of the Night</h3>
                    <p>At 10th level, while your Lunar Armor ability is active, your armor class instead becomes 13+your charisma bonus. Additionally, you may activate your reaction to deal radiant damage from Lunar Armor even when a creature fails to hit you. However, when you choose to do this, the target receives a dexterity saving throw equal to your warlock spell DC to halve the damage. </p>
            <h2>Level 14<hr></h2>
                <h3>Astral Armor</h3>
                    <p>At 14th level, your innate connection with your patron imbues you with many potent effects while you wear your Lunar Armor: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The armor bonus from Lunar Armor sets your total armor class to 10+your proficiency bonus+your charisma modifier. </li>
                        <li>You gain resistance to non-magical damage and radiant damage </li>
                        <li>You gain proficiency in Dexterity saving throws. If you are already proficient in Dexterity saving throws, you double your proficiency bonus when making them. </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Additionally, when you activate your radiant damage pool, the primary target of the attack does not receive a saving throw to resist the damage if you activated the feature in response to a missed attack. When you use it, not only does the target suffer radiant damage, but so do all enemies within 30 feet of the target. These creatures DO receive a Dexterity saving throw to reduce the damage by half.</p>
            <h2>Lunar Eldritch Invocations<hr></h2>
                <p>Midnight Mists - 3rd level: You can cast Fog Cloud at will, without expending a spell slot or material components. You must be outside to use this invocation.</p>
                <p>Lunar Aegis - 5th level: You may cast the Shield spell a number of times per day equal to your Charisma bonus. This recharges as the end of a long rest. </p>
                <p>Lunar Armaments - 5th level: You may cast the spell Spiritual Weapon once per day using a Warlock spell slot. You can't do so again until you finish a long rest. This weapon takes a shape of your choosing and deals Radiant damage instead of Force damage. </p>
