        <p>Bloodwave Bay is a place of freedom and opportunity. Being the only remaining inland sea not regulated by the other various countries of the world, it is a place of unexplored and unclaimed wonder. It is here where those that call themselves pirates, make their home. Their are many gifts Bloodwave Bay bestows to its denizens, as well as a myriad of sub-types to choose from. </p>

    </div>
    <div class="left">
        <h1>Brutal Coast</h1>
        <p>Baymen often have their favorite hunting grounds and are often shaped by their prey. Those that hunt the Brutal Coast of Steton, are shaped a little harder than most. The Brutal Coast is not only home to the savage Stetonians but, also to all manners of terrifying creatures. Baymen that face the Brutal Coast come back forever changed by it. They more than their brethren knows what truly lies beneath the water. </p>
        <p>You have also been shaped by the Brutal Coast. Becoming a bit more savage than one might expect of a normal Baymen, you have been shaped by those you steal from. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>You are relentless and savage. Once per round when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, the creature takes an extra 2 damage if it's below its hit point maximum </li>
            <li>Skill Prof – Intimidate</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="left">
        <h1>Copper Coveman</h1>
        <p>The Copper Cove is the only form of civilization within Bloodwave Bay. Many find their way to its ports, in search of rest, relaxation and of course profit. It is in Copper Cove that those of a questionable business make their sales. Gold flows out and in, like blood in veins. The heartbeat of Bloodwave Bay is the Copper Cove and here, in this place, there is honor among thieves, for they would band together in an instant to protect it. </p>
        <p>You have made your home here, living a free and relatively safe life. Your path was your own to tread as long as you can remember and you have always found a way to flourish. The Copper Cove is a place of profit and innovation… for those with ambition. </p>

    </div>
    <div class="left">
        <h1>Mage Coast</h1>
        <p>Baymen often have their favorite hunting grounds and are often shaped by their prey. Those that hunt the Mage Coast often find magical loot, constructs and spells among their gold and wealth. The wizards guild of Majital would have others believe are a minor threat, but in truth those that hunt the Mage Coast are too fast and careful, for even wizards to catch. Most of the time. </p>
        <p>You have sailed these waters for as long as you can remember. Your exposure to the magic from Majital has had a heavy impact on you. You have developed tricks and abilities to not only help you avoid the watchful eyes of the Taltaken, but to thrive in the shadow of the wizards guild. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>You have developed keen senses for the presence of magic – Skill Prof – Arcana</li>

        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="left">
        <h1>Navigator</h1>
        <p>Sailing the seas means not getting lost. Some Baymen are natural navigators, able to inherently make sense of charts and the position of the stars. These navigators are highly sought after. Their quick minds and good judgment make them so valued that other Baymen treat them with a little more respect than their peers. Not actually nobles by any means, Navigators sure don’t mind acting like it. After all, they earned it. </p>
        <p>You grew up with a head for numbers and the ability to find your way. In the Bay, such a gift is rare to be had at such a young age. Therefore, you were always treated a little better and kept alive as the highest priority. You also made quite a bit of profit. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>A navigator can always find his way. You always know north and you also have advantage on Survival checks to navigate. </li>

    </div>
    <div class="left">
        <h1>Privateer</h1>
        <p>No matter what you might call yourself, some were just born to fight. These Baymen are the ones that rise to be truly great, proving themselves in combat and dominating the seas. Not only hunting landwalkers but other Baymen as well, these Baymen are the alphas on the sea. </p>
        <p>You were dealt a cruel hand in your beginning, always having to scrape by, you knew one day you would be great and you knew how to take it. You trained in the sword, you hardened your body and now you take your glory! </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Self-taught may not be pretty, but its just as effective. You gain a +1 to attack rolls with improvised weapons and with any weapon you do not have proficiency with. </li>
            <li>Skill Prof - Acrobatics</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="left">
        <h1>Shipwreck Diver</h1>
        <p>Sometimes the life of hunting those on the waters isn’t nearly as profitable or as easy as scavenging the sea floor. There are those that brave the depths and the train their bodies rigorously in order to dive to the bottom of the sea, searching for hidden and lost treasures. </p>
        <p>You were one of these brave divers. You scoured the deep and have seen things most don’t even know exist. You have adapted to your underwater environment. </p>
        <p>You have spent so long under the water that its depths are like a second home.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You can hold your breath for 1 hour. In addition, you reduce damage taken from bludgeoning damage by 5.</li>
            <li>You gain proficiency in the Investigation skill, and with Carpenter's Tools.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="left">
        <h1>Spelunker</h1>
        <p>There are many caves to be found within Bloodwave Bay, each of them hold their own story and sometimes, that story is still being told. Whether it be searching for treasure or a place to hide, caves have always served the Baymen well. The caves of Bloodwave Bay are not without their perils, some Baymen have learned to thrive within these places. Using them as homes and storage areas. There are so many on the island-lets that dot the sea, that everywhere has potential to lead to something unexpected. </p>
        <p>You grew up within these caves, learning to guide yourself through them, developing heightened senses and an affinity for stone, you have thrived within these caves.. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Living your life searching for pitfalls and wayward paths, has given you special insight. You increase your passive perception by 5. This bonus does not stack with the feat, Observant. </li>
            <li>Skill Prof – Perception</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="left">
        <h1>Whispering Isles</h1>
        <p>Baymen often speak in whispered tones about places of darkness and terror. A series of islands is often the subject of these haunted tales. The Whispering Isles is a place not often traveled to and even less explored. Some however, whether they wish it or not, have made a home there. The things they see, they tell very few. </p>
        <p>You were born in this place. In the whispering mists and the haunted cliffs you played as a child. You had specters as friends and hags as neighbors. You are told to never speak of where you come from lest the secret haven be uncovered. This is a secret you intend to keep. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>You have always walked with spirits, some of their essence rubbed off on you. You may cast Speak With Dead once per long rest. You have advantage on Charisma skill checks versus spirits and undead creatures. </li>
            <li>Skill Prof – Deception</li>
        </ul>
