        <h1 style="text-decoration: underline; font-size: 2.5em;">Majital</h1>
        <p><em>Majital is a land comprised of desert and scattered oases. Once a vibrant paradise, the land was stricken dry in the war of the Skarab Lords.</em></p>
        <h2>Structure</h2>
        <p>Majital uses a magocracy define its government, using the ranks of the The Mages Guild for its highest political offices. </p>
        <p>The natives of Majital follow a simple democratic Khanate system.</p>
        <h2>Public Agenda </h2>
        <p>Majital has a history steep in magical superiority and as such it is no secret that Majital shall always seek to push past the boundaries of magic and into the unknown.</p>
        <h2>Assets</h2>
        <p>Majital's power has always been in its mages and the knowledge they collected over centuries. Majital's number one export other than its magical services is salt.</p>
        <h2>Demography and Population </h2>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>60% Humans</li>
                <li>25% Elves</li>
                <li>10% Gnomes</li>
                <li>5% Other</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h2>Territories</h2>
        <p>The Scour Sand</p>
        <h2>Military</h2>
        <p>The Mages Guild</p>
        <h2>Technological Level </h2>
        <p>Technology is by no means stunted in Majital, but due to the presence of an abundance of arcane knowledge any technology serves to enhance magic.</p>
        <h2>Religion</h2>
        <p>Majital has no official religion; however Runtheras, Cassius, Falaael and Raquel are commonly worshiped by the populace.</p>
        <h2>Foreign Relations </h2>
        <p>Majital has a shaky standing with most of the countries in Kalkatesh. The tyranny of The Mages Guild of the 5th era are still fresh in the minds of the people and although there is not open disdain there is certainly watchful caution and in some cases a cold war.</p>
        <h2>Agriculture and Industry </h2>
        <p>Majital has a few large salt mines that provide a productive economy and the Mage's Guild provides quite a bit of wealth with it's magical services.</p>
        <h2>Trade and Transport </h2>
        <p>The Gold Road stretches to connect the other world roads all throughout Majital and with it the trade of salt, magic and mages spreads to the rest of Kalkatesh.</p>
        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p>Majital boasts the highest literacy rate and education average of any of the countries of Kalkatesh. The Mages Guild has always treated the natives of the Scour with respect to maintain the peace, and see that they are educated and benefit from the bounties that arcane knowledge has provided.</p>
        <h2>Infrastructure</h2>
        <p>Outside of Mirage there is very little infrastructure and with the exception of the Gold Road, no roads to follow, only the twists of the dunes.</p>
        <h2>Origin Bonus</h2>
        <p>Majital is abundant in two things. Sand and Magic. This desert country although lacking in natural resources, makes up for this by being the home of the wizards guild. Majitalians are a people who value knowledge, ambition and privacy. Their cunning nature is matched only by the beauty of their darkened skin. Majitalians all possess the following abilities as well as a choice of sub-type. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>To some magic is a calling, but to a Majitalian, it is apart of everyday life. Majitalians begin play with Detect Magic as an at will ability. This functions as the spell in all other respects. You also have proficiency in the Arcana skill. </li>
            <li>+1 Intelligence</li>
        </ul>
