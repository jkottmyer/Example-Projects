        <h1 style="text-decoration: underline; font-size: 2.5em;">Orde</h1>
        <p><em>Within The Northern Heartlands lies the country of Orde. A supposed utopia of wealth and plenty. The citizens of which live under the constant supervision of The White Pantheon and its organized religions.</em></p>
        <h2>Structure</h2>
        <p>Theocratic Meritocracy</p>
        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>Orde was a country formed slowly from those that fled the fall of the Elven Empire. They quickly formed a country based on religious freedom, that believed that the cruelties and dark magics the Elven Empire used were the cause of their misfortune and misery. As time went on an ironic view of religious freedom was eventually replaced with the standard moral goods; this invoked a sense of order and good will, in exchange for a sharp prejudice. Every 20 years or so the White Council replaces its various parts, allowing new ideas to spread and change to become possible. However, Orde's mistrust of the darker things have led to many unfortunate events from war, to the rise of the Inquisition. The Reckoning shattered the belief system of Orde to its very core. Not only did they have to use the power of evil to assist in defending the Seven against a great threat, but they lost many of their deities of the past in this time of trouble. Modern day Orde attempts to follow the Seven's doctrine of hope, but old habits die hard and there is a stirring of mistrust and a quiet desperation for this peace can only be maintained for so long and the scales are imbalanced. The White Council has summoned the Inquisition as a safeguard against evil's inevitable return.</p>
        <h2>Demography and Population </h2>
        <p>The population of Orde is quite diverse, featuring races from all corners of Kalkatesh. Humans do come out slightly ahead in numbers, with tieflings coming in at the lowest. The ieflings Orde, although the country itself holds no official prejudice against them, do not feel comfortable in the country. Other races that share difficult to understand powers or forms usually stay within the outlier settlements.</p>
        <h2>Military</h2>
        <p>Orde's military force is mostly composed of the Order of the White Council, a contingent of paladins from The White Pantheon. There are also a few militia contracts with mercenaries in the outlier towns, which is comprised of religiously inclined warriors. The Justicars keep order as the main policing force for the cities.</p>
        <h2>Religion</h2>
        <p>The White Pantheon is unquestionably the most represented in Orde, most of the deities within it, have their main churches within the country. Other religions, save for those that serve evil are welcome within Orde.</p>
        <h2>Infrastructure</h2>
        <p>Orde is perhaps the most well developed in terms of infrastructure out of all the countries. Instead of only a few cities with paved roads, nearly all of the cities in Orde benefit from paved roads and fully operational aqueducts.</p>
        <h2>Origin Bonus</h2>
        <p>Majital is abundant in two things. Sand and Magic. This desert country although lacking in natural resources, makes up for this by being the home of the wizards guild. Majitalians are a people who value knowledge, ambition and privacy. Their cunning nature is matched only by the beauty of their darkened skin. Majitalians all possess the following abilities as well as a choice of sub-type. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>To some magic is a calling, but to a Majitalian, it is apart of everyday life. Majitalians begin play with Detect Magic as an at will ability. This functions as the spell in all other respects. You also have proficiency in the Arcana skill. </li>
            <li>+1 Intelligence</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Sub-Origins:</h2>
        <p>Backgrounds in Verum are replaced with an origin and sub-origin. Players select a sub-origin listed below and recived bonuses from both the origin and sub-origin.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="left">
        <h1>Church Child</h1>
        <p>Whether orphaned, donated or liberated, wayward children often find their way into the various churches of Orde. These individuals are raised in a place of safety and discipline. They are well read, fed an cared for greatly. This love and commitment is transferred with power from the church directly. As such, these few are born with special gifts and higher expectations. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>You gain a cantrip from the cleric spell list and may cast it at character level. </li>
            <li>Skill Prof – History</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="left">
        <h1>Ex-Priest</h1>
        <p>Their are an abundance of priests, clerics and paladins within Orde. Some lose their way, or realize some horrid truth. These afflicted few usually leave their faith and as such are changed by it. </p>
        <p>You are one of these few who have rejected their faith. Perhaps you saw an injustice, perhaps you saw a lie or perhaps you simply don’t believe anymore. Whatever the reason, your life will always carry a bit of what you once were with you. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>You may not follow a deity, nor may you benefit from any effect in which this is a prerequisite, this includes spells, classes, items and any other effect. This includes Patrons. You have learned to depend on yourself, now that you no longer call upon gods. You gain twice as many hitpoints when spending hit dice to heal during a short rest. </li>
            <li>Skill Prof – Insight</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="left">
        <h1>In Plain Sight</h1>
        <p>The Ordeans believe that they are safe and sound, just and right within their white walls and atop their marble cliffs. How little they know. For the unwelcome churches have made their home within and around these walls, hiding in plain sight. Those that whisper to the dark ones. Receive the blessings they need in order to survive. </p>
        <p>You have walked in deceit and shadow your entire life. Fake smiles and prayers are the masks you wear in order to further your goals. You are rather good at it. You reveal your nature to only those you trust the most, for if word got out of what you are, terrible things would happen. In order to find others hiding within plain sight all you must do is speak the secret words. “The sun sets.” If they are truly one of you they shall simply answer “The night begins” (The above will be changed to match deities at another time) .</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You choose a warlock cantrip. You may cast it at character level. </li>
            <li>Skill Prof – Deception</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="left">
        <h1>Lineage of Coin</h1>
        <p>Even the gods need money. While charity is all well and good, people dont eat on good intentions. There are those, that devote themselves not to a deity, but to the coin. While some Ordeans see them as almost heretical in their commitment to money, these few know the real truth, without money, the gods die. </p>
        <p>You were raised in the realm of accounting, trade and common sense. These traits you inherited within yourself. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Choose a single cleric domain, you may use that domain's channel divinity once per week. If you gain channel divinity from a domain you possess, you may instead change your channel divinity once per long rest to that of another domain. This choice remains until you change it. Your character level counts as your cleric level for the purposes of this channel divinity. Clerics cannot use this origin to change their Turn Undead channel divinity effect. </li>
            <li>Skill Prof – Persuasion</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="left">
        <h1>Lineage of the Barrister</h1>
        <p>There are those that live within the confines of Orde who understand the value of the various laws that govern the interaction between the great religions. These religions do not always agree with one another and have various methods to achieve their goals. To serve liaisons between these great entities is an honor and a lucrative position. </p>
        <p>You were born under the tutelage of law and order. Your early years were filled with lectures, debates and study. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Choose two tenets required by your class. You mustn't follow those tenets, but you may not actively work against your order or faith. </li>
            <li>Skill Prof – Investigation</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="left">
        <h1>Paladin in Training</h1>
        <p>Orde is the home to many of the main churches of the saintly religions in Verum. As such, there are many who attempt to answer the call of the paladin. Such a life is not for everyone however. Those that enter and fail aren't treated with shame in Orde, but rather with respect, for to attempt to become a paladin, is to reveal a caring nature. To fail doesn't mean these qualities did not exist, it simply means, that the person needs more time. </p>
        <p>You trained under the holy sword. Although their styles may vary, all paladins follow a strict code of honor in battle. You uphold this honor, and perform it to the highest standards. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>You have learned to strengthen yourself versus evil foes. Whenever you deal damage to an evil creature, you deal 1 additional radiant damage. </li>
            <li>Skill Prof – Martial</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="left">
        <h1>Wall Born</h1>
        <p>The great wall of Orde, holds back the denizens of the badlands and the watchers on the wall, keep a close eye upon the horizon. So large is the wall, that it could be considered a city in its own right, harboring thousands of soldiers and their families, it is easily the largest military application in Verum. Those that are born here learn of the dark things within the badlands and are taught vigilance, to ensure they are always ready. </p>
        <p>The vigilance of the wall guard is legendary.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You have advantage on attack rolls for opportunity attacks. </li>
            <li>You gain proficiency in the Perception skill, and with Mason's Tools.</li>
        </ul>
