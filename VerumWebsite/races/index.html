            <p class="raceinfo">
                The dragonborn are the dragonkind's last attempt to save themselves from fading from the world. Forged out of a modified recipe of creation that once formed the humans, the dragonborn represent the final vestige of the dragonstorm and indeed they are the legacy of one of the oldest creatures of the world. Dragonborn, like their human counterparts can choose any path they wish upon the world, but they are often times influenced by the draconic blood that flows through their veins. Dragonborn struggle in many ways with individuality and the unseen chains that hold them to the path their scales might depict.

            <p class="raceinfo">
                In the first era, as the Lizardfolk retreated to their mystic jungles and the elves spread across the rest of the surface, it was the dwarves that took their home in the mountains and the unknown wonders below. It was here that the dwarves developed the art of forging, of trade, of travel; their culture. So deep did the dwarves dig, that another world was made. A world formed from the caverns and crevices from below the surface. It was here, in the depths of the dark, that the dwarves longed to see the light above, but would not abandon what they had created. And so one among them, who would soon become their king, crafted for them this light out of a mysterious metal found within the deepest part of the earth. It was here that Astaroth created the Dark Sun.

            <p class="raceinfo">
                The long lived and aloof elves of Verum have a deep and morose history. Elves are often depicted with awe and jealousy, but most elves that live truly long lives wither away at just how much sorrow a single life can hold. There are many different types of elves depending on which world you are on and indeed Verum itself is home to many. The current subtypes available for play are the elves that exist on Kalkatesh. These are Wood Elves, High Elves and Dark Elves. Also living on Kalkatesh in some capacity are the immigrant Sharkai - the Ash Elves.

            <p class="raceinfo">
                They Fey hail from the Feywild, a land of magic and wonder. The Fey include Changelings, Satyrs, and Sprites. A changeling is born between the machinations of a hag and a mortal man. Changelings are always female and are constantly hounded by the call of their hag mothers their entire lives. Satyrs are horned fey spirits personify with an aspect of the other planes and form their bodies based on this. Sprites are small humanoid like creatures. Sprites are creatures from the Feywild. Sprites can be defined by traditional humanoids by the distinctive set of wings they possess.

        <h1><a href="giantkin.html" class="racelink">Giant-Kin</a></h1>
            <p class="raceinfo">
                During the second era when the Dwarves labored down below, the surface of Krazax was left mostly untouched. It was then that travelers from across the great ocean settled these mountains. These travelers were the first Giants. Over the course of that era the Giants spread, their form changing from the elements of Verum. Over time these giants took to raiding the humans of the lowlands. It was from their conquest that many half breeds were born, none as common as the Goliath. Because the Goliaths were beings formed from war, they have a culture defined by the primal fury of the giants and the anger of humanity. Though the Giants were pushed back by the Dwarves, the Goliaths remained. Being of two worlds with no place to call their own, the Goliaths formed small tribes within the fringes of civilization where they have remained content living simple, full lives. Most Goliaths seek adventure to proves themselves, to see new things, or due to the natural wanderlust from their ancestors. There are other forms of Giant-kin, but they have yet to be discovered.

            <p class="raceinfo">
                Gnomes are a curious race, they themselves were not born of the world like the other races, but rather within the veil beyond, within the realm of dreams. The first gnomes were simply dreamed up, a collection of errant thoughts that morphed from the dreamscape, when these being were first ‘born’ they themselves grew lonely and dreamed up more and more. They were all of them however, not truly alive, so Oun and Wode, gave them passage into the real world, so that they too, might truly live.

            <p class="raceinfo">
                The greenskins are a wild collection of races, toiling to make there way through the world. They are composed of orcs, goblins, hobgoblins, bugbears and more. The greenskins spawned from the various primal forces that saturate the mountains of Krazax, their strange cultures developed in spite of savagery and war. The result are creatures that are often misunderstood. While plenty of these creatures are evil by standard definitions through culture, they are not inherently evil in and of themselves.

            <p class="raceinfo">
                Halflings are a simple folk, enjoying the simple pleasures of life, the little things. They themselves have been in the backdrop of most of history, content to have a nice meal and relax in their homes. There have been, in moments of strife, where halflings were the uinexpected heroes, showing the world that they were as strong as any race and more importantly, fearless when the time came. Within them stirs the spirit of home and in equal measure, the conviction to defend.

        <h1><a href="humans.html" class="racelink">Humans</a></h1>
            <p class="raceinfo">
                The humans are a very strange sort who were originally created not in the traditional manner that most races are, but rather created by the dragons. The intent of this creation was twofold. First, for the humans to be able to breed and multiply; and second, to be used as a sort of fodder force, one that would mitigate the constant struggle against the elves and other older races. During this time, the humans slowly began to develop their own various cultures as they were held captive in many different places where the dragons lived. They began to start their own nations, but it was not until Cassius rising above with the help of Runethares did mankind finally move. But now humanity was faced with a very strange problem – they'd have to find their own place in a world not used to them. Humans could be of any walk of life, of any disposition and believe a whole matter of different believes. A human is just as likely to be your friend as they are just as likely to be your enemy and sometimes even both. Although they possess short life spans, they are able to accomplish so much that many other races hide a thin jealously of how they spend their lives.

        <h1><a href="lizardfolk.html" class="racelink">Lizardfolk</a></h1>
            <p class="raceinfo">
                Whereas elves and dwarves were given long lives, the Lizardfolk of Khao learned to survive. Their shorter lifespans and more primal forms lead them to create a simple yet more effective culture. As the elves took to the mainland and the dwarves took the mountains, the Lizardfolk took to the the jungles of Khao; hidden among the flora of the jungles, Lizardfolk were able to thrive in isolation. The jungles of Khao are vast giving plenty of space for Lizardfolk to expand and tribalize. Their beliefs spawned a spiritual connection and the creation of the spirits that they now server today. Being more akin to the natural world, the Lizardfolk have a more innate connection with the Green Pantheon and with the forces of nature. The Lizardfolk squabbled among themselves until nearly the end of the first age when the first and only lizard king was named: Ga’alathel (Ga-A-La-Thel). He lead his people to conquer the remaining area of Khao and to build a civilization that is mostly unknown to the rest of the world. However, this ancient civilization disappeared nearly as quickly as it rose by an unseen calamity. Today, Lizardfolk carry with them the primal lessons of their past and a quick and adaptable ingenuity. They are survivors at heart, above all else.

            <p class="raceinfo">
                Within Verum exists special races that do not belong to any other category. They include Dhampir, Revenant, Siren, and Kuo-Toa. Dhampirs are humanoids that have a partial connection to the curse of Vampirism. While not full vampires themselves, they carry many of the same burdens but also have some of the same gifts. A mockery of life, a Revenant is an undead husk of a formerly living creature. Revenants require battle to survive and thus feed off a small portion of the energy that a living being released once it is killed. Without a constant supply of combat and violence a Revenant will cease to be. Sirens spawn themselves from emotions of other creatures and feed on them for their sustenance. Kuo-Toa are a piscine race of warm-blooded amphibious humanoids that dwell within the deepest oceans of the realm. They have humanoid bodies and fish-like heads.

            <p class="raceinfo">
                The plane touched have been a pretty common occurrence within Verum. The inner planes have mixed with the prime for as long as they have all existed. This has lead to some interesting and bizarre occurrences as far as races go. Many different types of such creatures exist, they are as varied as the planes themselves whether they be the genasi, tiefling, aasimar, triton or something else entirely. Such creatures do not have much of a history, as they themselves are connected to two worlds. As such, most feel as if they do not belong, many are burdened by this feeling, others use it to fuel their ambitions to even greater heights.

            <p class="raceinfo">
                There are many races that call themselves Skinwalkers. These races are all bound by a single event: the curse of Gazenaroc. Save for the lizardfolk, nearly every being that is a mix of man and animal is a skinwalker. The skinwalkers vary as much as their human counterparts. While some have successfully integrated themselves into the world, others live in secluded colonies, hidden from persecution. Although the modern day skinwalkers are not cursed by Gazenaroc, they are born of the same ancestors that were. For long ago, some of humanity did not respect nature. They slaughtered its animals, plundered its forests, and reaped its fields, causing Gazenaroc to become enraged. Inca tried to plead on the humans behalf, saying that they were young and that time would teach them. Gazenaroc conceded and allowed Inca to try to convince them. However, as Inca summoned a contingent of dryads to speak to the humans, they were defiled and destroyed by the lawless bandits with no respect to nature. As the humans celebrated, Inca wept. Gazenaroc, pushed to the brink by his friend’s tears, cursed them all. They would learn to respect nature by becoming a part of it again. And so, the first skinwalkers were born.
